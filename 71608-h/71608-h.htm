  <h2 class='c005'>THE WOULD-BE-GENTEEL LADY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In such a country as ours—a country of
“workies”—where there exists no privileged
class, falsely so called, unless idleness and ennui
are privileges, one might suppose that a passion
for gentility would be confined to the fashionable
circles of the city; that the bees would as soon
be found giving preference to fashionable flowers,
or aiming at a fashionable style of architecture
in their hives, as the busy matrons and maidens
of New England, for instance, directing their
thoughts, mainly, to genteel modes of living,
dressing, and behaving.</p>

<p class='c011'>Doctor Johnson derives the word <i>genteel</i>, from
the Latin word <span lang="la">gentilis</span>: meaning “of the same
house, family name, ancestry, etc.” Its meaning
has, probably, undergone as many modifications
as the word <i>heretic</i>, of which the most accurate
definition I have ever heard was given by a young
boy of twelve: “A heretic is a person that don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>believe as you do.” It is plain he had not
obtained this information from books, but from
society. In like manner an ungenteel person is,
with many, one who does not live, dress, and act,
in all respects, as they do. The orthodoxy of one
age or country, is the heresy of another; and the
gentility of one, is the vulgarity of another.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it is with fashion, the handmaid of gentility;
who has been well described as a jade that
stalks through one country with the cast-off clothes
of another; and the modes and forms of gentility
are as variable as the wayward humors of those
vacant-minded people who lead the fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>How much more respectable, how much more
<i>American</i> it would be for us, of this country, to
limit the word, in our application of it, to something
like its original meaning, and make gentility
consist in living and acting conformably to the
circumstances of one’s family or station—not in a
slavish, ignoble imitation of comparatively a few
self-styled favored mortals, whose lot is cast in a
different, but not a happier sphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is one indispensable condition of absolute
gentility, in the popular sense, which very few
in our country can command, viz. an exemption
from labor; and a hard condition it is—not for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>those who lose caste on its account, but for those
who, by fulfilling it, acquire caste. God made
us to be active in mind and body—he gave a
spring to universal being—and standing water is
the fit emblem of a stagnant life. But even those
to whom this exemption may seem desirable, cannot
enjoy it, generally speaking, in our country.</p>

<p class='c011'>A southern gentleman, describing a New England
dinner, said, “In the first place, at the head
of the table is always a roasted lady.” Now,
although a southern dinner may not have so displeasing
an accompaniment, we are assured by
those who have been behind the scenes in families
abounding with slaves, that the mistress herself
is the greatest slave of all, since all the headwork,
and some part of the <i>handy-work</i> too, must
be done by her; for instance, she must weigh out
the food, and cut out the garments of her family
servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, notwithstanding this serious obstacle, nowhere,
we are assured, is there such a strife for
gentility, as in this country, where every other
strife most incompatible with that, is perpetually
carried on.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said to be peculiar to us, that our villages
ape, so minutely, the fashions of our cities; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>no sooner is a new fashion of dress, or of the
sleeve alone of a dress, introduced into the city,
than straightway, as by magic, every sleeve in
the country, from the shoulder of the squire’s
wife to that of her youngest maid, is fashioned
precisely after the same model, or, if varied at all,
exaggerated for the purpose of being <i>extremely</i>
fashionable. The stoutest ploughboy in the land
will not think of being married, without a silk
stocking to his brawny foot. Nor do our female
domestics consider their wardrobe quite complete
without, at least, one silk gown and one linen-cambric
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c011'>And how soon is the infection caught by foreigners
who come among us! The sturdy German
girl, although she may not immediately reject
her national peasants’ costume of stout cotton
stripe, and foot-gear adapted to the out-of-door
work she has been accustomed to, will be very
likely to surmount all with a “tasty” silk hat.
All this may be very agreeable as a proof of prosperity;
but it must be remembered that prosperity
without discretion, is as unprofitable as zeal without
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class='small'>R. Westall&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; W. Cook.</span><br>  <br>  “<i>Child of the thoughtful brow.</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>We laugh at these demonstrations in our inferiors,
without considering that we are guilty of
absurdities quite as palpable to those in another
rank from ourselves. It is said that ladies of
moderate fortune in America, dress far more expensively
than those of a corresponding rank in
Europe; that we indulge in many expensive
articles of dress which they would not think of
wearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>I once knew a lady with whom the passion for
gentility amounted almost to a disease. It seemed,
in her, an innate propensity, or, at least, it was
very difficult to account for it. Born in an obscure
country village, not entitled, either by her
rank in life, character, education, or circumstances,
to take precedence of her compeers, she nevertheless
very early began to assume airs of great
consequence, on account of superior notions in
regard to gentility. Probably, feeling the desire
which all have for consequence, and having nothing
else to build it upon, she had recourse to extraordinary
precision in various points of dress
and bearing, in which she vainly imagined gentility
chiefly to consist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father was a shop-keeper, or, as we are
accustomed to say, a merchant, doing business on
a small scale; both her parents were uneducated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>ignorant and small-minded people, but simple and
unassuming. Her ideas of gentility, therefore,
had been principally derived from novels, and from
intercourse with some of her companions who had
enjoyed a privilege she greatly coveted, but could
not be allowed, of a six months’ residence at a city
boarding-school.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a young lady, the great objects of her ambition
were a languid, delicate appearance, and
a white hand. This strange perversion of the
human mind is, I fear, not very unfrequent in
young ladies, and is a legitimate consequence of
subscription to a creed which virtually says, “I
believe that those only are entitled to the highest
place in society, who have nothing to do.” Health
is the vulgar privilege of the working-man. But
what a total absence of all <i>real</i> claims to interest
and admiration is implied in a young lady’s relying
for them, mainly, upon a sickly look! Who
would exchange roses, pinks, and lilies, with all
their beauty and fragrance, for the pale and scentless
ghost-flower?</p>

<p class='c011'>My heroine, in order to effect this favorite object,
had recourse to means which I should not
like to specify, but which are only too familiar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>I fear, to many of her sex—until her health became
so seriously impaired that she was, all her
life, a sufferer in consequence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mother, as mothers are apt to be, was exceedingly
indulgent to her, and although herself
obliged to strain every nerve in order to bring up
comfortably and respectably a large family, upon
very limited means, seldom obliged her to put
her shoulder to the burden. If it did sometimes
happen that she was inevitably called upon to do
other than some of the “light work” of the family,
a flood of tears washed out the disgraceful stain.
She had, therefore, the privilege of preserving
her hands white, while her mother’s wore the
vulgar aspect and complexion of hard drudgery.
And yet this abominable selfishness was not the
“original sin” of her nature; it was the result of
her mind being diseased on the subject of gentility.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was not until her marriage, when she
became Mrs. William Rutherford, and attained to
the dignity of a housekeeper and matron, that her
passion was fully developed. This was one of
those marriages brought about, as many are said
to be, “by juxta-position.” William Rutherford,
the son of a farmer, a plain, sensible, energetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>young man, who had, very honorably to himself,
made his own way in the world, studied in a
lawyer’s office overlooking a garden in which our
heroine often strayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sight of a pretty girl walking among the
flowers, was an agreeable variety to one whose
vision rested many hours in the day upon the
grave-looking, monotonous pages of a law-book.
He sometimes joined her, and she gave him flowers,
for which, without any reference to its being
genteel or ungenteel to like them, she had a genuine
admiration; and a jar that stood upon his
study table was daily supplied from her hand.
She was rather pretty, excessively neat in her appearance,
and seemed always amiable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most energetic person in the world is not
insensible to the necessity, or at least the <i>agreeability</i>
of excitement, and by degrees the plain,
simple, natural, sensible William Rutherford was
led on until he plighted heart and hand to this
very <i>pretensionary</i> and foolish young woman. O
the rashness of young men, and young women,
too, in these momentous matters!</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford had too much of the instinct
of a New England woman not to make a good
housekeeper. She had profited by the lessons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>received from her notable mother, albeit an unwilling
and truant pupil. She was excessively
nice in her habits, and would have her house in
order even at the cruel sacrifice of vulgar personal
exertions; but these were kept secret as possible
from neighbors and visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>An unfortunate visit which she made, the first
year of her marriage, to a cousin who had married
a wealthy merchant in New York, greatly enlarged
her ideas on the subject of gentility. She
had previously set her heart upon a watch, as one
of the ensignia, (now forsooth that very convenient
article is very commonly laid aside because it is
vulgar to wear it!) but now she had in addition
constantly before her eyes, in distant perspective,
a Brussels carpet, hair sofa, mahogany chairs,
and silver forks. These, though constituting a
small part of her cousin’s splendor, were almost
unknown articles in the village where she lived,
and, therefore, would be sufficient to distinguish
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although her husband was a thriving lawyer,
and had his fair proportion of the business done
in the county, yet his income was moderate;
and having amassed no property previous to his
marriage, it was necessary that in all his arrangements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>he should have reference to economy.
Great pains were, therefore, necessary on the part
of Mrs. Rutherford to secure these objects of her
ambition. Never did a politician keep more
steadily in view what are supposed to be the politician’s
aim, office and power—never did the
military hero keep his eye more steadfastly fixed
upon the wreaths of victory with which he hoped
to grace his brow, than did Mrs. Rutherford upon
her hair sofa, Brussels carpet, mahogany chairs,
and silver forks. For these she lived, and for
these she would have done any thing—but die.
There is, alas! no fashionable furniture for the
grave; it has no privilege save that of rest to the
weary. The folly of “garnering up one’s heart”
in the cunning but perishable works of man’s device,
in outward show, is very striking when exhibited
on so small a scale; magnificence covers
up the folly to many eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Objects pursued with such steady determination
are almost sure to be gained in time. Mrs. Rutherford
practised great economy with reference
to their attainment, and although her husband had
a far juster sense of the right use of property,
and had no taste for making more show than his
neighbors—what will not a quiet, peace-loving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>man do, that he can do, to tranquilize the restless,
unsatisfied spirit of his wife?</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Rutherford was a much enduring man.
If during the sitting of the court, (for he lived in
the county town,) he invited some brother lawyers
to dine with him, there being but an hour’s adjournment,
and the dinner failed to appear seasonably,
no earthly consideration would have induced his
wife to leave the room and inquire into the reason
of the delay—and still less to do what she might
toward preventing its further continuance: because
it would be ungenteel for the lady of the
house not to be sitting in state with her guests—and
horribly vulgar to be supposed conversant
with the mysteries of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the dinner arrived at last, if her only
servant, who officiated in the double capacity of
cook and waiter, were obliged to leave the room,
not a plate must be passed until she returned to
do the thing according to rule. No consideration
of urgent haste—of comfort or convenience—was
to be weighed for a moment with that of having
her table <i>genteelly</i> served.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, notwithstanding her extreme anxiety to
do the honors of her house, in what she supposed
the most approved manner, she was utterly incapable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of performing the most important, dignified,
and graceful part of the duty of a hostess,—that
of contributing to the intellectual entertainment
of her guests. In fact, she was deplorably ignorant.
To give a single example: The conversation
falling one day upon old English poetry, a
gentleman said to her, “I believe, Mrs. Rutherford,
that Pope is not so great a favorite with the
ladies as formerly.” “I don’t know, indeed, sir,”
she replied; “was he a novelist? Scott is the
favorite novelist now, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was indispensable to her system to have always
the air of being waited upon. If the fire
were down ever so low, she would prefer waiting
any length of time, until her servant of all-work
could answer the bell, rather than help herself
to a stick of wood, although close at hand. A
friend knocking for admission, might almost go
away without getting it, if there were no one but
the lady of the house to open the door. Even a
journey, recommended by her physician, for her
only child, who had suffered much from teething,
was not to be thought of, because the additional
expense of a nurse could not be afforded: and it
was <i>so</i> vulgar to travel with a young child without
a nurse! And yet she was not an unfeeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>mother—she would do anything for her child
that was not vulgar. Nights of weary watching,
and days of laborious nursing, she submitted to
with true maternal devotion. Even in his very
wardrobe, her husband’s comfort was abridged,
in conformity with her notions of what gentility
required, inasmuch as at no season would he be
allowed a cotton shirt, which in the winter he
greatly preferred.</p>

<p class='c011'>I said that by degrees Mrs. Rutherford attained
all her objects. I beg her pardon—the silver
forks were still wanting to her complete happiness.
Against these her husband took his stand
with the determination of a desperate man. He
said they were very proper for those to use who
were born with silver spoons in their mouths—very
proper for those who could afford them; but
for a young man in his circumstances, the introduction
of such an article into his establishment
would be perfectly preposterous—that silver forks
would be a poor inheritance to his daughter, provided
he left her nothing to eat with them. It
was so very unusual for her husband to oppose
her, that Mrs. Rutherford knew his opposition
was not impulsive—not lightly resolved upon;
and she yielded to it submissively.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The child was of course included in the mother’s
plans of gentility. She was not suffered
to attend school for fear she should contract vulgarity
from her schoolmates. Great pains were
bestowed upon her dress; and as what is deficient
in money must be made up in time, there was a
most lavish expenditure of what is still more valuable
than money. Then she was prevented, as
far as possible, from doing any thing for herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>This last point, however, was difficult of accomplishment.
Little Caroline herself was an
extremely smart, active, capable child; and such
a one, who feels the energy stirring within her,
cannot well be prevented, in such a very unartificial
state of things as exists in a village family,
from exerting it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not often that a child derives benefit from
her mother’s absurdities; but Caroline Rutherford
was an exception. The very opposition she met
with confirmed all her natural tendencies to rationality;
and, in consequence of her being excluded
from the schools, her father took great pains
with her education, while her mother paid a degree
of attention to her manners; which, though
it could not render her formal, (no training could
have produced that result in her case,) had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>effect to make her considerate and attentive.
She grew up, therefore, a very pleasing, lovely
girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she was about the age of fourteen, a
very exciting event occurred in their quiet village.
A gentleman of fortune, who had determined to
remove into the country, attracted by its healthy
and picturesque location, selected it for his future
residence, and purchased a place very near the
dwelling of Mr. Rutherford.</p>

<p class='c011'>This circumstance was rejoiced in by no one
so much as by Mrs. Rutherford; and would have
gone far toward compensating her for the want
of silver forks, except that it made her feel the
need of them so much the more; because, “how
could she invite Mr. and Mrs. Garrison to dine
without them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She lost no time in calling upon her new
neighbors, choosing for that purpose the latest
hour compatible with the country dining hour.
She had previously arrayed herself in the manner
she deemed most befitting the occasion; that is,
most calculated to recommend her to Mrs. Garrison
as a person of undoubted gentility, viz:
with a dress of Gros de Berlin, a French cape,
silk stockings, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>To her surprise, she found Mrs. Garrison in a
simple gingham morning dress, superintending
the nailing down of a carpet; for her house was
not yet in order. She received Mrs. Rutherford,
however, in a very easy manner, conducting her
to an adjoining apartment; and thus, after the
usual preliminaries, was the turn given by the
latter to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I quite pity you, Mrs. Garrison, for having
chosen a residence in the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pity me, indeed! I thought all people who
lived in the country were fond of it. Is it not so
with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O yes! I am very fond of flowers, and I
think the country more healthy than town; but
then we have such trouble with our servants.
Such a thing as a man-cook is quite out of the
question. I often tell my husband that there
would be some sense, and some pleasure in having
one’s friends to dine with you, if one could
have a man-cook.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A man-cook, indeed!” replied Mrs. Garrison.
“I did not know that such an appendage was
ever thought of in the country. It is far from being
common in town; and for myself, I have never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>employed one. If I can get good women I shall
be entirely satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ma’am, you cannot be sure even of
that; and then, if your servants happen to leave
you, it is so difficult to supply their places. Really,
Mrs. Garrison, to be left as we are exposed to be
occasionally, almost without any help at all, is a
calamity almost too great to be borne. Housework
is so odious, so disagreeable, I almost loathe
myself when I am obliged <i>to take hold of it</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This last expression led Mrs. Garrison to suspect
that she had been quite accustomed “to take
hold” notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But your country ladies, in spite of these
difficulties, have more leisure than we in town.
You are not obliged to keep one servant to answer
the bell, and to spend the best part of the
day yourself in receiving visits from a set of idlers,
as formidable, to those who really value their
time, as the unproductive consumer to the political
economist.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Mrs. Rutherford found herself at fault.
She looked quite puzzled for a moment, and then
replied—“<i>But you do not give refreshments to your
morning visitors, Mrs. Garrison? That, I am told,
is quite out of fashion.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“And then, too,” continued Mrs. Garrison, not
appearing to notice this question, “we necessarily
have a very large circle of acquaintance for
many of whom we care very little; whereas, you
in the country can limit yourselves as much as
you please; and society is, with you, on altogether
a more free, unceremonious, and friendly footing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But then,” replied Mrs. Rutherford, “country
people are, most of them, so vulgar. They know
nothing of the forms of society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So much the better. In large circles of
society they are necessary, but burdensome; and
I expect to enjoy, very much, a more simple, unshackled
state of existence.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* I had
the pleasure of seeing your daughter, I believe,
this morning; a charming looking girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My daughter! O Mrs. Garrison, I am very
sorry indeed. She is a wild girl; and her father
would indulge her to-day in a strawberrying frolic,
so she was dressed accordingly. I am sure she
was not fit to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot say how that may be, for my attention
was so occupied by her bright eyes, rosy
cheeks, and laughing smile, that I did not notice
her dress at all. But the most proper dress is
always that most befitting the occasion; and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>looks to me like a girl of too good sense not to
have regard to the fitness of things at all times.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dress is another great trouble in the country,
Mrs. Garrison. There is never a good dressmaker
to be had. You may have your dress cut,
to be sure, after a fashionable pattern; but then
it will not have at all the air of a city-made dress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought, Mrs. Rutherford, that exemption
from much trouble of dress was another of
your country privileges. In town, the tailor and
dressmaker are the most important personages, to
be sure; since it is not man as God made him, or
as he has made himself, but as the tailor makes
him, that is chiefly respected by a very large
class—and so with woman; but in the country,
people are valued for their intrinsic merits—their
minds, and their hearts. This is their privilege
and distinction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I think, Mrs. Garrison, that no woman
appears well who is not well dressed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean, by being well dressed, dressed
with neatness and propriety, I agree with you;
but city finery, habitually worn, would seem to
me as much out of place on the person of a country
lady, as artificial flowers in her bosom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford took her leave, wondering to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>find Mrs. Garrison, a <i>lady</i> in every sense of the
word, so full of what she considered very odd
notions; and did not fail, at dinner, to communicate
to her husband the impression she had received.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am thankful,” he replied, “that she is a
woman of some sense. I beg your pardon, wife,
but really your head is completely turned upon
the subject of furniture, dress, etc.; and if Mrs.
Garrison will set it right, she will do the greatest
piece of service in the world that could be rendered
to a poor fellow like me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Mr. Rutherford, I flattered myself you
were quite proud of your wife. I am sure it is
as much on your account as my own, that I wish
to hold my proper place in society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your proper place! Yes, I wish to heaven
that would content you; but you <i>do</i> make capital
pies, wife, I confess,” he said, as he tasted a delicious
tart. Mrs. Rutherford was more gratified
by his commendation, than she would have been
had she understood its full import.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Mrs. Garrison, in relating to her
husband the events of the morning, said: “We
talked, you know, of adapting ourselves to the
tastes, manners, and habits of the country; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>here is a village lady whose head is as full of
fashions, modes, and rules of etiquette, as the
finest town-lady’s of them all. How should it
happen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An empty-headed woman I’ll be bound,” replied
Mr. Garrison.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as to that I cannot tell. She certainly
gave no great signs of intellectual cultivation,
and that is the case with most of our fine ladies
in town; but one would suppose that in the country,
if a woman did not love books, she might
busy herself in her domestic occupations, with
bees, birds, flowers, etc., without being driven to
dress and fashion as a refuge from the ennui of a
vacant mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a strange race we are,” rejoined her
husband, “to make it our boast that we are rational
beings. I think, if those to whom man is
said to be only a little lower look down upon this
busy scene, the pursuits of the greater part of
men, and women too, must seem just about as
important as the children’s sport of blowing soap-bubbles
seems to us. One thing I have to congratulate
myself upon—the principal lawyer in
the village, Mr. Rutherford, is a very clever, sensible,
respectable man.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“He must be this very lady’s husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor fellow! I am sorry for him then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Caroline Rutherford returned from her
strawberrying expedition, which had been very
successful, she begged to be allowed to carry
some of her strawberries to Mrs. Garrison, who
by her sweet voice and pleasing address had made
a most agreeable impression upon her in their
short interview in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford was quite shocked at the suggestion.
“Why, my dear child, your dress,
shabby enough at best, is all in disorder. Your
hair is out of curl, and you are red and heated.
Besides, it is much more proper to send Sally
with them. Get me a piece of note paper, and I
will write a note.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O, mother, do let me have my own way for
this once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father nodded in a manner which expressed
“go, my child,” and she was off in the twinkling
of an eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O dear me! Mr. Rutherford, Caroline is so
wild, so rustic, I am afraid Mrs. Garrison will be
quite disgusted with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never fear, my dear. I will pit my wild
flower against the finest green-house plant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>them all;” and well he might be proud of his
wild flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of Caroline’s being “such a rustic,”
Mrs. Garrison took a great fancy to her from the
beginning, and she soon became a favorite with
the whole family. The oldest daughter, Fanny,
was two years younger than Caroline, and two
of the sons were older. The mother was not
long in discovering that Caroline would be a most
useful associate to her children in their lessons;
and she invited her to join her little family school.
Her industry, energy, and quickness were a constant
stimulus to her fellow-pupils. Mrs. Garrison
taught her music and drawing, which almost
made Mrs. Rutherford forget the one calamity of
her life—the doing without silver forks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding her great delight when Mr.
Rutherford ordered a piano for his daughter, she
could not refrain from hinting that she thought
him rather inconsistent in incurring such an expense,
after what had passed on the subject of the
forks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, wife,” said he, “I do not admit this at
all. The forks, in our case, would be for mere
show; but the piano will be a source of constant
daily enjoyment. The pleasure of a song from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Caroline, accompanied by her instrument, is to
me worth all the pomp and magnificence of a
palace; ’tis ‘a sacred and home-felt delight.’
Then, think how she enjoys it! Besides, all these
things add to the resources from which she would
not fail to derive her support, if left penniless
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That Mr. Rutherford might feel no scruples of
delicacy in regard to receiving all these favors for
his daughter, Mrs. Garrison employed her to assist
in teaching the younger children.</p>

<p class='c011'>Caroline often excited her mother’s astonishment
by her reports of what was going on, from
time to time, at Mrs. Garrison’s. One day they
had all employed the recess in assisting Mrs.
Garrison, in country phrase, “to clean up her
yard;” which, in this instance, amounted only to
gathering from the lawn the dry leaves, bits of
sticks, etc., which had been carelessly left behind
by the person who had been sent to perform that
duty. At another time Caroline had had the sole
charge of the school in the morning, because
Mrs. Garrison, reduced to extremities by some
disarrangement of her domestic establishment,
had been engaged in washing windows! and performing
divers other services of a similar nature;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>but “I can tell you, mother,” she added, “that
she looks just as much like a lady when she is
washing windows, as when she is sitting at her
drawing-board.” Occasionally, when the waiter
had been ill or absent, one of the children had
tended table in her stead; and once, when one of
the servants was laid up with a rheumatic limb,
her mistress would bathe it herself, several times
in the day, in order to be sure that it was properly
done. But the greatest wonder of all was, that a
young sister of Mrs. Garrison’s came to visit her,
bringing an infant without a nurse to take care of
it; and not only that, but dragged it about the
streets of the village in a little wicker wagon, while
mother and child were both so pretty as to attract
every body’s attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the expiration of two years after their first
arrival in the village, Mr. and Mrs. Garrison determined
to obtain the assistance of a private tutor
in the education of their children. They were
fortunate in finding a young man, a Mr. Cleaveland,
of accomplished education and pleasing
manners, who knew how to make his pupils like
not only their books but their teacher too. He
was in the condition of many young men in our
country, whose education constitutes their only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>fortune. He was destined for the pulpit, and had
yet to acquire his profession in part.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fanny Garrison, accustomed hitherto only to
her mother’s teaching, could not be reconciled
to the idea of being taught by a strange gentleman,
unless Caroline would become a fellow-pupil.
Nearly two years passed away, during
which Caroline made rapid progress in various
branches of education—outstripping even the older
boys in some of those studies which, until recently,
have been almost universally regarded as inappropriate
to women.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford had already begun to speculate
upon Caroline’s chances in the matrimonial lottery.
She had no doubt that such a girl, with a
fine countenance, engaging manners, highly educated,
and full of vivacity, would, in time, make
“a <i>genteel</i> match.” Now and then a vague fear
that young Cleaveland might aspire to the hand
of her daughter, crossed her mind; but did not
impress itself, because it was “impossible that a
girl so genteelly bred and educated, should think
of marrying a poor young minister, and almost
equally so, that a poor young minister should
think of aspiring to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She settled it in her own mind, that if Caroline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>should have altogether a suitable offer in the
course of a few years, it was not to be rejected;
but otherwise, there could not be a doubt that
Frank Garrison’s present youthful fondness for
her might be cultivated into a permanent sentiment.
The country maid and her milk-pail will
remain through all time the faithful and most fitting
personification of a castle-builder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford could not forbear communicating
to her husband some of her thoughts upon the
subject which occupied her so much, and declaring,
in unequivocal terms, her unwillingness
to Caroline’s making only a “common match,” on
the ground of her being a fit wife for a man of
fortune, and qualified to grace a genteel establishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, I will tell you what, wife,” replied her
husband, “you do not know what is best for yourself
or her either. Caroline is just the girl for a
good, honest fellow, who has got to make his own
way in the world; such a man wants just such a
helper, or help-meet, as the Bible has it. It would
be a pity to have her good sense, and fine spirits,
and energy, and education thrown away where
they ain’t wanted, or rather where they won’t be
all called into requisition and turned to the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>possible account. He who gets his living by
hard work, whether of the head or the hands,
wants a wife who will order well his house and
educate his children—who will strengthen him
in weakness—encourage him in despondency—confirm
him when irresolute—soothe him when
irritated—comfort and bless him perpetually with
her sympathy, and look bright, beautiful, and refreshing
to him when the day’s toil is over. Now
a rich man’s wife need not <i>do</i> any thing; his
wealth can command the aid of hands enough and
heads enough, without hers. Then his pleasures
are very apt to be in a great many other things
besides his wife; and a woman who knows how
to dress smart, and receive his company genteelly,
as you say, will do very well for him. But to a
poor man his wife and children are his all-in-all
of pleasure; and to make the happiness of a man
who has every thing good in himself, but to whom
the gifts of fortune have been denied, ought to be
sufficient to satisfy any woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course Mrs. Rutherford rejected such heretical
doctrines altogether, though she had no hope
of converting him who professed them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the simple, happy Caroline mused
not of love; she was too happy—too much occupied—too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>well satisfied with the present, to
think of the future. Life, with her, was perpetual
sunshine. She was very fond of her father—had
a kind and dutiful feeling toward her mother—loved
the Garrisons dearly—was exceedingly
interested in her studies—and liked Mr. Cleaveland
very much. She liked him because she
found his assistance very valuable to her in her
studies—because he was not only exceedingly
devoted, in his office as teacher, to all his pupils,
but made them very happy—because he manifested,
in all situations, great delicacy of feeling
and the kindest consideration for others, showing
that he felt deeply and tenderly the bonds of human
brotherhood—because he had an agreeable
talent at conversation—because he loved the
water-falls, fields, rivers, and groves as well as
she did, and, when school was over, liked nothing
better than to ramble and sport in true country
fashion—and lastly, she liked him, as I suppose,
because he liked her; for a reason akin to
this, enters, more or less, I believe, into the rationale
of all the partialities of man for his brother
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Garrison felt some responsibility in regard
to bringing so lovely a girl as Caroline Rutherford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>into constant association with a marriageable
young man of no small attractions. But she knew
him thoroughly—was certain that he was worthy
of confidence, and, besides, was herself constantly
with the whole group, both in school and in the
hours of recreation.</p>

<p class='c011'>How could Charles Cleaveland but fall in love?
Not at first sight—not because it had seemed to
him a very probable thing that he should; but
because there was no earthly reason why he
should not—because there was every thing to
please his fancy, gratify his affections, and approve
itself to his reason, in the young creature
with whom he was daily associated in interesting
pursuits and delightful recreations. In school
she was that paragon of perfection to a teacher,
a diligent, docile, and apt pupil; by the stream,
a naiad; in the groves, a wood-nymph; in the
garden and the meadow, the ideal of a bird or a
butterfly. How could she but come, in time, to
haunt his imagination and make her home in his
heart, in one and all the bewitching forms of love’s
metempsychosis?</p>

<p class='c011'>His interest had been for some time deeply
excited, before she became aware of the state of
his mind or her own. But the truth gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>dawned upon her when, time after time as she
raised her head, she found him intently gazing
upon her; when she perceived unwonted abstraction,
on his part, in the hours of her recitations;
when she found herself, by some strange
magic or other, meeting him at every turn, as if
he knew all her out-goings and in-comings;
when his visits at her father’s hitherto, on account
of her mother’s forbidding manners few and
far between, became more and more frequent;
and as she sat at the piano, where he always
liked to place her, she could <i>feel</i> the intensity of
his gaze until it produced a burning in her own
cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she, too, began to muse of him. He was
the subject of her day-dreams and night-dreams;
his image forever in her mind; sleep did not
displace it. It was there when she closed her
eyes to sleep, and there to greet her at the first
moment of her waking. The animated Caroline
became pensive; the social Caroline began to
affect solitary walks and lonely sittings in her
chamber. She gazed upon the moon, or she listened
to the murmuring brook or the whispering
grove; and the gay and joyous feeling with which
she had been accustomed to mingle herself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the harmonies of nature, gave way to one of sacred
tenderness, as they seemed to her spirit to
give forth a deeper tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still her natural equanimity came in aid of her
maidenly reserve to conceal from her lover the
true state of her heart, and he felt by no means
certain that his love was requited. But neither
was he hopeless; and knowing that it would be
difficult for him to carry himself toward her as
he ought during the three months that still remained
of his engagement with Mrs. Garrison
without having an explanation with Caroline,
which it would be improper for him to seek while
he stood in his present relation to her, he determined
to ask it as a favor of Mrs. Garrison that
she would release him, which he did, of course,
without assigning his principal motive.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning after this arrangement was made,
Mrs. Garrison entered the school-room just as
Caroline was finishing a recitation, and said,
“Now, children, do your best to leave an agreeable
impression upon the mind of Mr. Cleaveland,
who is going to resign the charge of you in two
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Caroline turned deadly pale, and the paleness
was instantly succeeded by a deep blush.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>She took up her book and returned instantly to
her seat, hoping she had been unobserved; but
she was mistaken. Such a revelation is rarely
lost upon a lover; and, in this instance, did not
escape the observation of Mrs. Garrison.</p>

<p class='c011'>At any other time, Mr. Cleaveland would have
been gratified by the lively and most unaffected
demonstrations of regret with which the announcement
of his speedy departure had been received
by the whole group of children. But now, one
deep joy swallowed up all the rest; and his utter
inability to reply to them would have been extremely
embarrassing, had not Mrs. Garrison
kindly and considerately relieved him by a request
that he would look into a new school-book
which she had just received.</p>

<p class='c011'>His only trouble in life now, was the interminable
duration of two weeks. That period of
time overpast, he would declare his love, and then
devote himself to his profession with the intent
to hasten, as much as possible, the time when he
might claim his bride. Meanwhile, Caroline had
no resource but to put on, as far as possible, the
appearance of being more than ever absorbed in
her studies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford had not been unobservant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the signs of the times in regard either to Caroline
or Cleaveland, and felt extremely uneasy and
anxious. Her husband, on the contrary, she
knew would like nothing better than just such a
match for his daughter; and therefore she determined,
in the present emergency, to keep her own
counsels and act for herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>During this last memorable fortnight, Cleaveland
almost entirely suspended his visits to the
Rutherfords, and his intercourse with Caroline,
except as her teacher; because he found it almost
impossible to carry himself toward her as
circumstances required.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the last day Caroline, although she had
got up with a violent headache, would not remain
at home for fear of exciting suspicion or
remark; but her illness was so apparent, that
Mrs. Garrison had insisted upon her leaving the
school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cleaveland had not <i>seemed</i> nearly as much
occupied with herself, as usual, ever since his departure
had been determined upon. She was in
no state to solve the problem of this change by
an argumentative process, and she began to think
she had deceived herself—that she had been
merely an agreeable and exciting circumstance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in the present scene of his residence—no longer
valued when he was so soon to exchange it for
another. When she went home, therefore, she
threw herself upon her bed, and burst into a flood
of tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile her lover with difficulty possessed
his soul, until the hour of emancipation came, and
he felt at liberty to throw himself at her feet. He
then went in pursuit of her, in the sweet hope that
by a few magic words—the lover’s sesame—he
should unlock her carefully guarded heart, and
find its wealth all his own. No one was at home
but Mrs. Rutherford.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Miss Caroline?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has gone to walk—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone?—which way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something in his manner which
revealed, or, at least, led Mrs. Rutherford to suspect
the nature of his errand. She believed that
the crisis had come, and that now, if ever, was the
moment for interference.</p>

<p class='c011'>To his questions she only replied, evidently
somewhat embarrassed, “Mr. Cleaveland, I want
to speak a word with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was already on his way out, and turned
most reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Walk into the parlor a moment, Mr. Cleaveland.
I don’t know how Mr. Rutherford feels
about this business, but I think that, as a mother,
I have a better right than any one else to decide
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cleaveland, at first, would not guess to what
she referred; and, perceiving that he did not understand
her, she continued: “I know it is a very
delicate matter for me to take it for granted that
you would like to marry Caroline. If I am mistaken,
there is no harm done, and you will excuse
me; if I am not mistaken, it would be too
late, after you young people had settled the matter
between you, for me to express my decided disapprobation
of it, and therefore I do it now. I
appeal to you, Mr. Cleaveland, as a mother,
whose soul is bound up in her child, to give up
all thoughts of a connection which would fall
very far short of my hopes and wishes for my
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment, poor Cleaveland sat like one
stupified. Then, without any parting salutation
to Mrs. Rutherford, without even a single word in
reply to her strange harangue, he hastily left the
house. He retreated to his own room; but experienced
there a stifling sensation, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>thought to relieve by going into the open air; and
pursuing his way to a favorite haunt, he met
Caroline just emerging from the little grove he
was about to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not daring to trust himself with her a moment,
and unable to command his voice, he hastily passed
her with hardly the seeming of a recognition.
Her headache had left her much exhausted, and a
dizzy faintness now came over her, so that it was
with great difficulty that she reached her home,
although not very far distant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile her lover was in a most piteous
state of agitation and perplexity. Was he obliged
in honor to heed the matrimonial veto? Believing
that Caroline was attached to him, was it
right to keep her in ignorance of his love? Her
father, too, had given him the most undoubted
proofs of his esteem; and so far from showing any
jealousy or suspicion of him, had always acquiesced
entirely in all those arrangements which
had brought them together so much, might he not
refer the matter to him? But to appeal to the
husband against his wife—to the daughter against
her mother—this would be neither manly nor
delicate, perhaps not honorable; he was not quite
sure. To fly, then, was his only refuge.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>He wrote a note to Mrs. Garrison, complaining
of illness, saying that he had been induced, by
unexpected circumstances, to leave town, contrary
to his first intentions, on the following day;
but that, on the whole, he preferred not taking
leave of them personally, as the parting would,
on his part, be a very painful one. He thanked
her, in glowing terms, for all her kindness, adding,
that he never expected to be so happy again as
under her roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Garrison was surprised by this last expression;
surprised by his hasty departure, and
by his omitting to make his adieus in person; and
had a vague idea of some mystery in the matter,
which she hoped time might solve. He went off
at two o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford took especial care to conceal
the fact of his having called to see her, from
Caroline, who forbore to make any inquiries; and
Mr. Rutherford being out of town, no investigation
was made upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Caroline! her brightness was, for the
present, all obscured. Her headache returned
violently, and she was really ill for some days;
but even after she had no longer an excuse for
playing the invalid, her spirits did not return;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>she had sleepless nights and languid days, and
her very soul seemed to have died away within
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father was excessively distressed. At
first he tried to rouse her spirits by a little raillery.
“You remind me,” said he, “of a fine peach-tree
which I came near losing last spring. It was in
full life and beauty, just as you were, but suddenly
a blight came over it which threatened its destruction.
I dug around the root and found one little
worm there—that removed, the tree flourished
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Caroline made no reply, but burst into
tears and retreated to her room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There <i>is</i> a canker-worm at the root, you may
depend upon it, wife; and it appears to me that
you might detect it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rutherford looked as if she were a little
disturbed at the idea of any investigation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do know, wife,” said he, “and don’t
choose to reveal what you know, the responsibility
rests with you, and her blood be upon your head.
Tell me, now, what is your idea upon the subject,
has not Caroline been unhappy ever since young
Cleaveland went away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Did you ever think that they were in love?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought <i>he</i> was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet he went off without broaching the
matter at all. If it is all on her part, the thing
must be submitted to; and yet it seems to me he
could hardly help falling in love with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Rutherford, gathering
courage to do now what she had half resolved to
do before, “he did fall in love with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then why did he not tell her so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I forbade him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he apply to you on the subject?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I applied to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then how could you be certain that he had
any design of offering himself to her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would not have had any doubt of it had
you seen him as I did; and besides, he would
have denied it if it had not been so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“O wife! what <i>was</i> your inducement? He is
not <i>genteel</i> enough for you, I suppose. Confound
your genteel notions,” he continued, as, losing
control of himself, he became exceedingly exasperated;
“I would give all the gentility you ever
had, or ever can have, for a few grains of sense
or common maternal feeling. I knew you would
give up health, and comfort, and good neighborhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and your own soul, if necessary, for gentility;
but I thought your child was dearer to you
than your own soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Mr. Rutherford, I do really think you
are very unkind,” said the lady, bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How the devil,” he continued, without heeding
her emotion, “did you ever come to marry
such an ungenteel fellow as I am, and thus establish
a precedent for your daughter to follow?
Go and comfort her, and say to her, ‘My dear,
console yourself that I have saved you from the
disgrace consequent upon such a connection as I
had the misfortune to form.’ Tell her never to
mind losing the chance of being made happy by
a capital fellow whom she loves, and who loves
her, because by-and-by, if she live long enough,
she may possibly marry a money-purse, ride in
a carriage, tread on Brussels carpets, and have a
plenty of mirrors and glasses to see herself in,
and couches to recline upon, and silver forks to
eat with—who knows? Tell her it is all a mistake
to suppose that happiness has anything to
do with the mind or the heart; that it is all a
thing of the eyes. Tell her its foundations are
laid up in brick and mortar, and its superstructure
is comprised of all the costly materials that can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>be gathered together from the four corners of the
earth. Go now, quick, wife, call her down stairs,
and bid her look at your best parlor—your better
half—and tell her you expect she will have a
whole suit of such apartments, only a great deal
finer. Say to her, ‘Look at it, Caroline; gaze
on it, my child, and forget the image of him who,
though God’s noblest work, cannot afford to manufacture
happiness for you out of cabinet-ware
and upholsterers’ stuffs.’ Go, wife, and be eloquent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having thus <i>exploded</i>, he left the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor Mrs. Rutherford had never heard her
husband indulge in such a vein before. She was
kind and attentive to his comfort, and his disposition
led him to make the most, both to her and
to himself, of whatever in her was good and commendable.
She did not suspect, therefore, that
there ever lurked in his bosom a feeling of contempt.
It was a wretched day for the whole
family.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening, after Caroline bade good-night,
the subject was renewed. Mr. Rutherford had
thought much and deeply upon it. Had Cleaveland
avowed his love, he might go to him at once,
and tell him that his wife repented the step she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>had taken—but now, what was to be done? he
could not tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Matters went on thus for about three months,
during which Mrs. Garrison shared in the solicitude
which Caroline’s parents felt on her account—although,
in seeing her droop, she could only
guess at the cause. She corresponded with Mr.
Cleaveland, but he never mentioned Caroline—and
she could only venture upon what might
seem an accidental reference to her, and allusion
to her poor health and spirits. At the end of
three months she received from him the following
letter:—</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>My dear Mrs. Garrison</span>—Your very great
kindness, and your most generous sympathy so
constantly manifested towards me, induces me to
lay before you a matter that very nearly concerns
me, for the purpose of obtaining your advice in
circumstances of great delicacy and perplexity.</p>

<p class='c012'>I think it could not have altogether escaped
your observation, that, as would probably have
befallen most other young men in like circumstances,
I lost my heart to your fair young friend,
my pupil. Nor was I a despairing lover—may
my presumption be pardoned, in believing that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>occasionally discovered through the veil of her
most delicate and maidenly reserve, a certain
tremulousness of feeling which that veil could
not entirely disguise—an occasional agitation of
manner on her part, from which I derived the
flattering conclusion that it was sometimes given
to me to touch “the electric chain with which
she’s darkly bound.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But I waited until one relation with her should
be at an end before attempting to establish another;
and just as I was on the point of declaring
myself, her mother, suspecting my intention,
interfered to prevent its fulfilment—saying, as
nearly as I can remember, that such an union
would fall far below her wishes and hopes for
her daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>I do indeed feel that I am not worthy of such
a treasure as Caroline Rutherford. But I suppose
it would be doing Mrs. Rutherford no injustice
to believe that my most striking deficiency in
her eyes, would be made up at once, were I to
come into possession of a fortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am very wretched—and it is possible that I
am not alone in my wretchedness. It does not
seem fitting that the destiny of two human beings
capable of acting and choosing for themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>should be controlled by idiosyncrasies of a third
person. It does not seem fitting that if we are
capable of loving and making each other happy,
we should be separated by such a paltry wall of
partition. I have a strong impression, too, that
Mr. Rutherford would favor my suit. And yet,
what can I do? How am I to break the fetters
that Mrs. R. has thrown around me? Give me
your counsel, I pray you, and add one more to
the many obligations which you have already
heaped upon.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your very grateful and affectionate friend,</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>Charles Cleaveland</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Garrison was not long in deciding what
to do. Her great kindness to Caroline, and the
services which she had rendered her, entitled
her to act in whatever concerned her welfare.
Having provided herself with a store of arguments
to overcome all objections, and set the matter in
its true light, she determined to appeal directly
to Mrs. Rutherford herself. To her surprise and
joy, she found her most thankful to avail herself
of the opportunity to retract her injunction. Her
home once so pleasant, had become so cheerless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and her husband so estranged—to say nothing of
Caroline—that in the exigencies of the present,
she forgot all her visions for the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course Mrs. Garrison lost no time in communicating
the result to her friend; and Mrs.
Rutherford was no less eager to inform her husband
of what had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now,” said he, “Caroline shall know
of this at once. She must have it explained to
her sooner or later—why Cleaveland went off in
so strange a manner; better hear it from me than
from her lover; it will be awkward for him to
tell it; and, besides, she has suffered enough already;
and now, when better things are in store
for her, the sooner she enters into the enjoyment
of them the better.”&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* Before Caroline
slept that night, there was, for her, balm, and a
physician—and her sorrows were all healed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next week the lovers met without explanation,—save
the tears of Caroline, and the trembling
lips and hand of Charles. They met, as
if they had parted acknowledged lovers, and
been, since that time, cut off from each other by
some sore calamity. From their dark hour broke
forth a rosy dawn which in time was kindled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>perfect day. The bloom soon gathered again on
Caroline’s cheek, and her eye was once more
soul-lit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Charles was not long in obtaining a respectable
settlement. Caroline was henceforth permitted to
manage her own affairs; to make her outfit such
as became a country clergyman’s wife, with every
provision for comfort and none for display; and to
have a perfectly unostentatious wedding, without
a supper—without even champagne.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lived to realize her father’s beau-ideal of
a woman’s happiness—to be the “all-in-all of
pleasure” to a man in every way worthy of her.</p>

      <div class='line'>I sought him in that fearful place,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>I gaz’d once more upon his face,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Exchang’d one sad farewell—</div>
      <div class='line'>And then, a crime-stain’d exile, he</div>
      <div class='line'>Was sent to dwell beyond the sea.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then, then, I was indeed alone—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sense, duty, reason, all were gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Life was one racking sense of pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>One only thought dwelt in my brain,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see my victim-love again.</div>
      <div class='line'>To soothe his grief, support his care,</div>
      <div class='line'>His shame, his punishment, to share.</div>
      <div class='line'>But how, from whom assistance claim?</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE BARLOW KNIFE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>BY ROBERT JONATHAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was one event of my boyish days which
is the cause of such amusing reminiscence in my
later years, that I cannot refrain, dear reader, from
making you acquainted with it. It happened upon
a time, after I had worn out my first frock coat,
and got tired of trundling hoops and wagons, and
drawing sleds, that I felt, as many boys do, an
inordinate desire to experience the comforts of
<i>whittling</i>; but I had no knife—always excepting
an old <i>case-knife</i> which mother used to lend me.
But then, this was not <i>the thing</i>; for, besides
being inconvenient, I could not <i>shut it up</i>, and put
it in my pocket, and walk about with the proud
consciousness that it was <i>my own</i>—not <i>borrowed</i>
from any one, but <span class='fss'>MINE</span>—sacred to <i>my</i> individual
use and behoof. However, believing that my
youthful happiness depended upon the gratification
of this desire, I treated with mother to negotiate
with father upon the subject of procuring me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>a knife. This was on a Saturday afternoon in
the month of July. Mother told me that, if I
would be a good boy, and <i>keep</i> that night and the
next day (Sunday) as I ought, and go to school
every day, and study hard, and mind the schoolmistress,
and divers other conditions—to all of
which I eagerly consented without considering
the possibility of fulfilling them—on these conditions,
I say, she, on her part, promised to ask
father to give me a <i>knife</i>. Accordingly, in pursuance
of our stipulations, I kept Saturday night
very well—went to bed early—went to sleep,
and straightway to dreaming of the glorious fruition
of all my hopes. I dreamed that I had a
new knife—that I “<i>sharpened it up</i>” until it would
<i>cut a hair</i>—that I had a soft piece of seasoned
white pine—that, in fact, I was <i>whittling</i>! And
how inexpressible was the delight which I experienced!
Surely moral philosophers should give
mankind—at least the <i>boy</i> part of it—credit for a
new and additional sense, which they should term
<i>Whittleation</i>, and upon which they should base
a new science and denominate it <i>Whittleology</i>.
For what natural sensation is there which can be
compared with that which is experienced while
drawing the keen-edged blade through the delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>fibres of some soft, well-seasoned wood?
So far as my boyish experience extends, there is
no enjoyment so deep, so soothing, and so satisfactory
as that derived from <i>whittling</i>; whether
it be upon a shingle or a school-bench—upon the
squire’s picket-fence or the village sign-post. But
to my dream. All things went on charmingly
until an unfortunate turn of my shingle brought
my knife-blade in contact with one of my fingers,
and the pain of the wound thus inflicted, dispelled
the delightful vision which had enthralled me.
And so impatient was I to have Monday morning
come round, that I could sleep no more that night,
and, although it was but an hour before daybreak,
still it appeared to me that weeks were crowded
into that short period, while I was waiting and
watching for the blessed dawn of the Sabbath.
Finally, daylight appeared; and with its earliest
dawn I arose and began to whistle “Heigh Betty
Martin,” in great glee; but on recollection of my
treaty with mother, I ceased whistling and walked
down into the sitting-room with all the assumed
gravity of a Friar Tuck, and with a face long as
a grape-vine, and sombre as a dying cypress. I
attended church all day, and did not take my eyes
off the minister, except during prayers; but sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>up in the pew straight as a new pin, the big drops,
(not <i>tear</i> drops, however,) following each other
down my cheeks and neck at stated intervals,
much as though a frozen squash was <i>thawing</i> on
my head. After returning from church I took
up my catechism, and when I thought mother’s
eyes were on me, my own were on the book;
but when she was out of the room I amused my
little brother Dick, by telling him in a whisper
sufficiently loud to be heard over all the room,
that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In Adam’s fall</div>
      <div class='line'>We made stone-wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>But ever <i>sense</i></div>
      <div class='line'>We’ve made brush-fence.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>And</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But as mother did not hear me, my youthful conscience
was perfectly at ease—considering, of
course, that there was no wrong done when there
was no knowledge, on her part, of any transgression.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>At length, after many weary hours, <i>sun-down</i>
was proclaimed through the house by my little
sister Mary, who had been watching its approach,
for an hour or more, from one of the garret windows.
I then made noise enough to remunerate
me for keeping half a score of Sabbaths. I
mounted my Eclipse broomstick with a determination
to run him on the course for the last
time, previous to giving up the pleasures of the
chase for the quiet comforts of <i>whittling</i>. And,
indeed, it <i>was</i> the last time; for, in the last
quarter of the third heat, in the exuberance of
my spirits I reared up, and, my foot slipping, I
came with such force on to my wayworn charger
that I broke him down, and into two pieces besides;
and, in addition, I got a severe thump on
my cranium, which sent me weeping to bed,
where I slept quietly until Monday morning. On
that morning I was, of course, in very good spirits,
and did not fail to give mother a gentle hint touching
her part of the contract, by taking <i>particular
pains</i> to have her <i>accidentally</i> discover that the
handle to the clothes-pounder had come out, and
by <i>carelessly</i> observing, in a very <i>emphatic</i> manner,
that <i>if</i> I had a penknife, I would make a
wedge and fasten in the pounder handle, etc.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>However, that day and the following night were
doomed to be hours of anxious suspense to me—hope
and fear holding alternate sway in my excited
breast. But words have not power to express
the fulness of my joy when, after breakfast
on Tuesday morning, father called me to him,
and, taking a new knife from his pocket, placed
me on his knee, after which he gave me several
sections of good advice and kind admonitions, to
which I listened with all the attention bestowed
by a barn upon a whirlwind, so deeply was I
engaged in scrutinizing the new object of my
desire.</p>

<p class='c011'>When father had finished his lecture, it was
<i>school-time</i>; so, after <i>greasing</i> the spring of my
new knife, grasping it firmly in my right hand,
and thrusting said hand into my pantaloons pocket,
I started for school, anticipating a “glorious triumph”
in exhibiting my newly-acquired property
to my less fortunate playmates. But, just as I
stepped on to the school-house green, the schoolmistress
<i>rattled the window</i> and called the children
in; and thus my thrilling hopes were prematurely
blighted. Still firmly holding my knife in my
pocket as I entered the school-house, I took my
seat on the “<i>big bench</i>” where I usually sat, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>after the school operations had fairly commenced,
I turned round to the desk with my back to the
mistress and my book before me. I then took
out my new knife for the purpose of examining it
more particularly than I had hitherto done. It
was of that kind commonly called <i>Barlow</i> knives,
one half of the handle being of polished iron and
the other half of bone; the blade about four inches
long, half an inch wide near the handle, and
tapering to a point. Bill Williams, who sat next
to me, soon got a glimpse at it, and we soon got
<i>whispering</i> about it; and the consequence was, we
both got shut up in the <i>dungeon</i>, and were kept
there until noon. Great was my joy during the
<i>noon-spell</i> in exhibiting my new treasure; and
many were the congratulations which I received
upon the pleasure of possessing it. In the afternoon,
not profiting at all by my morning’s experience,
I took it out in school-time and tried its
shaving powers by cutting the bench; which the
schoolmistress happening to discover, she took it
away from me, gave me a feruling, kept me
half an hour after school was out; then, after
giving me a long lecture, and at the end of it my
knife, she sent me home. There I had a fine
opportunity to indulge my whittling propensities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>during the whole evening; but finding my knife
rather dull, I stole into the dining-room and stole
out of a drawer in the sideboard my father’s razor-hone,
which I took out under the wood-house and
there gave my knife a grand rubbing. Unfortunately
for me, however, the more I sharpened it the
duller it grew, and the more it spoiled my father’s
hone; for, on bringing this latter to the light,
I found it was a good deal worn and very much
scratched. Here was a new difficulty; a good
scolding, and perhaps a “<i>dressing</i>,” for spoiling
a nice razor-hone. However, I put it slyly back
into the drawer and determined to say nothing about
it, knowing that father would discover it the next
time he shaved himself; at which time I should
endeavor—accidentally, of course—to be <i>absent</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I next tried to sharpen my knife upon a scythe-stone;
but, as Dan O’Rourke would say, “the
more I tried to give it an edge, the more it would
‘not take one,’” until, finally, from desperate
necessity, I came to the grievous conclusion that
my knife was good for nothing. Consequent upon
this conclusion, was a determination to get rid of
it as soon as possible. But, alas! here was only
the beginning of my sorrows, as the sequel will
show.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>My first attempt was to <i>swop</i> it away; but as
none of the boys had such a knife as I wanted,
this could not be done. I next called my younger
brother Dick to me, and asked him if he did not
want a <i>present</i>? He, of course, answered in the
affirmative. Thereupon, after showing him my
knife, how well it was <i>sharpened up</i>, etc., and
making him promise to carry my books to and
from the school-house during the remainder of
the summer, I made him a <i>present</i> of the knife.
He was exceedingly delighted with this acquisition
to his personal property, and immediately ran
into the yard to find something to whittle. I
looked through the window to watch his success.
He first picked up a decayed mullen stalk, and
attempted to cut off the end; but, instead of <i>cutting</i>
it off, the pressure of his knife <i>broke</i> it off
close by his hand. He next picked up the end
of an ox-goad, and tugged away at it, turning his
head sidewise, and twisting his tongue and mouth
into all manner of shapes, but <i>not a shaving could
he raise</i>! He then found a piece of pine shingle,
which he succeeded in splitting lengthwise, but
could neither <i>sharpen</i> nor <i>round</i> it. Just then, two
of his playmates coming along with a ball, Dick
put his knife into his pocket, and went to join them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>in a game of “<i>one-old-cat</i>.” I thought to myself,
as I was almost bursting with laughter, “I was
<i>very</i> fortunate in getting rid of <i>that</i> knife at any
rate.” On the following morning, father went to
get his shaving apparatus, and, of course, discovered
his ruined hone. However, as soon as I
saw him start for the sideboard drawer, I started
for the wood-house chamber, where I lay concealed
until school-time. I went to school with
the determination not to go home at noon, and
supposed that by night the hone business would
all be got along with. But my hopes were again
doomed to disappointment; for when father came
home in the evening, he asked me if I had “been
using his hone?” Now, as I had been taught
that, let consequences be what they might, I
must never tell a <i>lie</i>; true to <i>such</i> instructions, I
promptly answered—“Yes, sir.” “For what
purpose?” he inquired. “To sharpen my knife,”
I answered. “Well,” said he, “as you are so
fond of sharpening knives, go get the case-knife
your mother lends you, and sharpen that.” Accordingly,
I got the case-knife, and he got the
hone, and I went to <i>honing</i>, and he went to reading
the newspapers. Now, the case-knife was a
good deal like my Barlow knife; the more you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>sharpened</i> it, the <i>duller</i> it grew. After rubbing it
about half an hour, being somewhat tired, I took
it to father, and told him “it would not come
sharp.” “Oh, well,” said he, “you have not
honed it long enough; it is a knife, and, of course,
can be sharpened. Try it again.” So at it I
went once more; and, after rubbing it until my
mouth was dry as a cotton-bag, and my arm
almost exhausted, I took it again to father, and,
with tears in my eyes, told him “it would <i>not be
sharpened</i>.” “Well, my son,” said he, “when I
questioned you about the hone, you promptly told
me the truth; for this I commend you, and I have
made you hone the case-knife as a punishment
for spoiling my hone. Now the next time you
want a razor-hone to sharpen a Barlow knife upon,
you must ask for it.” I made divers promises on
the subject, and fully resolved, in my own mind,
that I never would use his hone again without
permission.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the following Sunday morning I put on my
best suit to attend church; and, after I had got
down into the parlor, I unconsciously thrust my
hand into my coat pocket, and great was my surprise
when I drew from it my <i>Barlow knife</i>.
“Dick,” said I, “did you put <i>your</i> knife into my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>pocket?” “That’s not <i>my</i> knife,” said Dick.
“Don’t you want it?” I asked. “No!” he
answered. “Why not?” I inquired. “Because
it will not <i>cut any</i>,” rejoined Dick; “and I shall
not carry your books this summer for <i>such</i> a knife
as that,” and thereupon he hopped out of the
room. The next day, while up in the orchard,
back of the school-house, I contrived to have it
slip out of my pocket, and satisfied my conscience
by telling myself that I had lost it. More than a
week had I passed in the enjoyment of this quiet,
pleasing consciousness of having lost my knife,
when, one morning as I was going to school, Bill
Williams ran up to me, saying, “Bob, here’s your
knife: I found it under the big sweet apple-tree.”
“Botheration take the knife,” I thought, as I put
it into my pocket. After school was out at night,
I went up the road some distance from the school-house,
to a <i>sand-pit</i>, from which the neighbors
occasionally got a load of <i>scrubbing-sand</i>. Here
I dug a hole as deep as I could, threw in my knife,
buried it up, and went away, rejoicing in the belief
that I should never see it again.</p>

<p class='c011'>About two weeks after this, Peleg Bunce, my
father’s hired man, was sent, by mother, to get a
load of scrubbing-sand; and when I came home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>from school Peleg said to me, “Robert, here’s
your knife,” at the same time reaching it to me.
“My knife!” I exclaimed, in a manner and with
feelings compounded of sanity and insanity.
“<i>Divil</i> burn the knife,” I whispered to myself,
not wishing to speak a bad word distinctly.
Peleg found it in the sand-pit; and he knew it
was mine, for he once borrowed it of me to make
a <i>bow-pin</i> for old <i>Brin</i>—but returned it, of course,
without accomplishing his object. Once more I
put it in my pocket, and began to reflect how I
should ever get entirely rid of it. At last, a plan
occurred to me, which I conceived to be faultless.
There was a <i>pond</i> near my father’s house, at the
outlet of which stood a large blast furnace. I
determined to <i>drown</i> my knife. Accordingly, lest
its own weight should not be sufficient to keep it
at the bottom, and to make “assurance doubly
sure,” I got from the barn a piece of halter with
which I tied a pretty good sized stone to my
knife, and threw it into the furnace-pond. And
great was my joy to see it turn and turn around
until it sank out of my sight. Soon as it had
fairly disappeared, I fetched a heavy sigh of mingled
joy and suspense—then turned home with
a light and happy heart. Sweet was my rest that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>night, and pleasant were my dreams. Week
after week passed away, and my old knife likewise
passed into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c011'>One bright and beautiful morning in October,
old Russell Case and his two sons came down
from the mountain on which they lived, to fish in
the pond; and as they were notorious fishermen,
they generally had quite a company of boys to
watch their operations. As it was not yet school-time,
Bill Williams and myself went to see them
draw their seine. They took a good sweep into
the pond with their boat, then came on shore and
commenced hauling in. We were all anxiously
watching for the fish, and nearly the whole of
them had been emptied on the beach, when Bill
Williams exclaimed, “Why, Bob, <i>there’s your
knife</i>!” And sure enough, on hauling in the last
joint of the seine, what should be hanging to it but
my knife with the string and stone attached to it!
Perfectly astounded at this discovery, I could
almost have prayed that the waters might rise
and overwhelm seine, fishermen and all! However,
the thing was easily explained; for the
piece of halter which I used happened to have
been made of <i>hemp</i>, and the <i>knife</i> not being as
heavy as the string, while the stone lay on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>bottom, <i>that</i> was elevated some inches from it, and
so the fishermen caught it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more, with a heavy heart, I put that old
knife in my pocket. A deep feeling of disappointment
and melancholy took possession of my
mind, and long and seriously did I ponder upon
the best means of ridding myself of this tantalizing
treasure. In vain had I endeavored to <i>give
it away</i>—in vain, to lose it—in vain, to drown it.
Light, at last, seemed to dawn through the gloom
that had gathered upon me, and my resolution
was soon taken. I repaired one evening to the
furnace—went into the top-house, and there
waited until they began to put in their hourly
supply of coal and ore. I then thrust my knife
into the box of ore which I thought the <i>filler</i>
would put in first. I did not wish to throw it
directly into the top myself, for this would seem
like doing an evil deed, and such a one I did not
wish to do. Strongly and quickly did my heart
beat as I watched the baskets of coal disappear;
and, finally, my whole frame shook with agitation
when I saw the filler take the box of ore
which contained my knife, and toss its contents
into the furnace! A long-drawn sigh gave vent
to the conflicting emotions which had agitated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>my mind, and I turned homeward with a feeling
of deep, almost overwhelming satisfaction and
delight, that my eyes had certainly beheld, for the
last time, my old <span class='fss'>BARLOW KNIFE</span>!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now for a story!” said Henry Jackson, as
he put the last piece to a dissected map, which
lay on the table before him; “Grandmother, do
you remember you promised to give us one of
your best to-night, if I could put this new map
together; and see, here it is, every bit in its
place—all right!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not quite so fast,” said George Gray, an intelligent
youth of fourteen, who, with his sister
Ann, was spending Christmas-week with his
cousins in town; “not quite so fast, Henry; see,
here is a part of the Hudson spliced on to the
Connecticut; and New York and New Haven
have fairly changed places!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What of that!” returned Henry, biting his
lips with vexation, as he saw his mistake; “I
don’t care for that!”</p>

laying her book and spectacles, at once,
aside, “never allow yourself to say, I don’t care;
for, besides being generally a falsehood, it always
shows a bad disposition; and no good ever came
of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But George needn’t feel so smart because
he’s a little quicker and more forward than I am,”
replied the boy. “I guess, if I lived out of town,

taking the aggrieved side, “I think our George
<i>ought</i> to know something about it, for he was a
whole evening, only last week, putting together
the dissected picture uncle William gave me; and
I am sure it plagued him just twice as much as
this map has you, cousin Henry; but I do not
think he meant to be unkind to you, either; and
I don’t know why he should, you are always so
kind to us: and I’m sure you’re full as forward,
and quick to learn any thing as he is; and you
know you are about my age, almost two years
younger than George.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are a good girl, cousin Ann—and I love
you,” said Henry, wiping the tears from his
brightening eyes; “you always have such a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>to put one in good humor, and reconcile every
thing. Now, George, give me your hand; I will
acknowledge I was wrong in getting vexed with
you, and speaking as I did, especially now you
are visiting me; and I ought to do every thing to
make your time pass pleasantly. I was wrong,
too, in saying I did not care; for I <i>did</i> care.
Grandmother, I hope <i>you</i> will forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With all my heart, my child,” said the good
woman, folding her arms round the affectionate
boy; “God grant you may always be as ready
to acknowledge your faults!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now brother is sorry for doing wrong,
and has made it all up with cousin George, you
<i>will</i> tell us a story, won’t you, dear grandmother?”
said Helen, a child of seven years, who was leaning
over the arm of Mrs. Gray’s chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do tell one pitty long,” said little Mary,
a lisping infant of three years, laying her curly
head in her grandmother’s lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that peace is restored, my children,”
said Mrs. Gray, looking fondly upon each one of
the little flock that gathered round her, “I will
tell you a story of one from whom we are all
descended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was her name Gray?” asked Ann, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Not at the period to which our story refers;
though afterwards it became so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are in haste for you to begin,” said Henry,
hurrying books, maps, and pictures, without any
order, into a table drawer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be impatient, child—old folks never
like to be hurried,” said Mrs. Gray; “and I’ve a
good will not to tell you any story at all, just for
huddling up your things in such a slovenly manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive poor Henry once again,” said the
good-natured Ann, “and I will put them all nice;”
and she took the things all out of the drawer,
and placed the books neatly in the book-case,
and laid the maps and pictures into a portfolio;
and when she had done she said, “Now, grandmother,
are you not ready?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not quite yet,” said Mrs. Gray, with an affectionate
smile; “you, my dear Ann, are such a
neat little girl, I’m sure you will be willing to
wait till Sally has swept the hearth and replenished
the fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Replenished is among my definitions,” said
little Helen; “but I didn’t know that it had any
thing to do with making a fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Making a fire!” repeated George; “didn’t I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>tell you only yesterday, that we cannot <i>make</i> fire,
but only kindle it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you did tell me so, to be sure; but I
didn’t believe you. I guess if you had been here
the other night when the Universalist Chapel was
burnt, you would think somebody could make a
fire—and a pretty large one, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you tell me the meaning of the word replenish?”
asked Mrs. Gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, replenish means—it means—to fill up,
I believe; but I don’t see as that has anything
to do with fire, after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why if we add wood to the fire, and so fill up,
or nearly fill up, the fireplace, may it not be
called replenishing? You commence the critic
early, child,” said the grandmother; but she was
far from being angry with little Helen for her remarks;
“for it is right and proper for children to
inquire, and understand, and learn all they can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, grandmother,” said George, “I have
placed your chair in the warmest corner—the fire
<i>is</i> replenished, if Miss Helen will allow me to
say so—the hearth is swept—Sally has got her
knitting, and is going to sit down with us—and
we are all ready, and impatient to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish father and mother would be out at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>party every night,” said little Helen, as the circle
of happy and inquisitive children took their respective
seats, and drew around Mrs. Gray; “for
you, dear grandmother, always sit with us when
they are out; and so do brother, and cousin
Ann, and George—and we have such happy
times!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The good lady drew the youngest child to
her arms; and, taking the hand of Helen, who had
drawn her little chair very close to her grandmother,
thus began:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a cold night in December, 1664. The
winter wind was howling among the bare forest-trees,
and whistling through the heavy and open
casements of a few small houses, which stood in
the midst of the wilderness, upon a spot then
mostly known as the Plantations. It was Sabbath
evening. The family belonging to one of the
most comfortable looking houses rose up slowly
from their usual evening devotions, and drew
round a large and blazing fire. The snow and
hail beat furiously against the one window of the
room, and for some minutes no one spoke: and
then they heard a low groan as of one in the
agonies of death; and this was followed by a faint
screech and a moan of distress.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“‘The Indians! the Indians!’ cried a boy about
six years old, and he hid his little head in his
mother’s lap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Nobody shall hurt my boy!’ said the father,
patting his head, ‘nobody shall harm thee, child;’
and he rose up, and putting on a broad-brimmed
hat turned up at the sides, and taking an iron-headed
cane, he began to unfasten the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thou wilt not, Simon Gray,’ said the wife,
laying a hand on his arm, ‘thou wilt not open our
dwelling to the enemy?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thy fears are natural, Rebecca,’ said the
husband, turning with momentary hesitation, ‘for
verily, hath the cunning enemy been as a snake
in the grass to the Lord’s people.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Look forth from the window, first, then,’ said
the wife; ‘hast thou lived so long in the wilderness
and not learned that the wicked one is full
of snares?’ But a succession of low groans, apparently
near the house, overcame his fears; and
hastily unfastening and throwing open the narrow
door, he said, ‘Farewell, Rebecca—the arm of
the Lord is forever with his children!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Forsake me not, Simon,’ said Mrs. Gray,
lifting the little boy to her arms, ‘I will go with
thee;’ but he had already passed the threshold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and thrown open the gate that led from the little
enclosure around their dwelling. He paused;
listened again; and passed into the street. The
cries were repeated, but not so loud or so frequently
as they had been. He paused again and
looked around, but still saw nothing but the thick
falling snow, which beat so heavily as to obscure
almost everything; besides, it was very dark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was it, grandmother?” whispered Helen,
“who was it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, sister!” said Henry, “she was just going
to tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again,” resumed Mrs. Gray, “again he heard
the same low cry; and just as his wife came up,
he stumbled upon a human figure crouched at the
foot of a very large snow-bank. It proved to be
an Indian woman, almost perished with cold and
hunger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The Lord be praised! and bless thee, Simon
Gray!’ said Rebecca, as she assisted her husband
to lift the poor creature from the earth; ‘the Lord
be magnified!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Leave Namoina, take de baby!’ said the
poor creature in broken English, and she pointed
to a dark heap at a little distance; but at the
instant William had reached the spot, and, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>his mother came up, he uncovered the face of a
sleeping infant. The little creature was wrapped
in a thick covering of blankets, and was sleeping
as peacefully amid the snow as if it was lying
in its own mother’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rebecca knelt beside the little one, and blessed
God that she had been the instrument of saving
its life. The falling snow, and the cold wind
blowing upon the child’s face, awoke it; and as
it opened its eyes it looked up in the face of
Rebecca, who was kneeling beside it with a lantern
in her hand, and smiled, and lifted up its
little arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The Lord has sent thee to me,’ said Mrs.
Gray, while her heart was filled with tenderness.
‘The Lord has sent thee to me, to lie in my bosom
and be unto me instead of my own little buried
Rebecca!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The good man and his wife were not long
in removing the poor Indian woman and the child
to the house, and, for some time, the poor creature
did not appear to know what was passing around
her; but after having taken some hot drink she
seemed to revive, and cried out, ‘Me baby! me
flower!’ and she looked wildly round for the
child. Mrs. Gray laid it on the mat beside her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and the little one sat up and twisted its little
fingers in her wet black hair, and then nestled
close to the Indian woman’s bosom till she slept.
Mrs. Gray then carefully removed the child, and
fed it with some warm milk. The poor little
thing, as if conscious of her kindness, looked up in
her face and softly repeated, ‘Mamma—mamma.’
The imperfect words went to the heart of Rebecca;
and she again resolved that, as the Lord
had cast the little stranger upon her protection,
she would be unto it a mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. and Mrs. Gray hoped to learn something
of the child when the Indian woman should be
restored, but they were disappointed; for she
arose at the dawn of day, and stealing softly to
the bedside of Mrs. Gray, and taking the child
from beside its new mother, she appeared about
to carry it away; but Mrs. Gray, as she awoke,
observing her, cried out, ‘Give me back the babe!
give her to me!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Indian woman fixed her piercing black
eyes upon the face of Rebecca for several minutes,
then closing them, she appeared to be reasoning
with herself; for, upon lifting them again,
she said, solemnly, ‘The God of the white man
calleth for his child. The rose cannot bloom in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the desert. The lily springeth not in the wilderness.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus saying, she chanted a kind of prayer in
the Indian tongue, and folding the babe an instant
to her bosom, she replaced it beside Mrs. Gray;
and before any one could speak or prevent her,
she had thrown open the door and passed swiftly
from the cottage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Rise, Simon Gray!’ said the kind-hearted
Rebecca, ‘rise and follow the poor creature, and
persuade her to stay till the storm is past, and
offer her food.’ But though the good man made
all possible haste in dressing, the woman had
reached the summit of a high hill which lay
toward the Bay colony ere he got into the street;
and soon she was lost in the distance and the
thick falling snow, which was still beating down
with great violence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she freeze to death, grandmother?” asked
Helen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she never return?” inquired Henry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll both get answered when grandmother
has finished her story,” said George Gray, with a
shrewd look to his cousins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, all in good time, children,” said Mrs.
Gray, as she resumed. “They could not possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>find out how the Indian woman came by the child,
or, for certainty, who she was; yet by her calling
herself Namoina, they supposed she must be a
woman who was called by her tribe cunning, and
revered as a prophetess, though the white people
knew that the poor creature was at times crazy;
for she had seen her husband and child bleed,
both in one day; the first fell and died while defending
his home; the other was inhumanly murdered
by wretches who deserved not the name of
men! And so poor Namoina, or, as the white
people called her, Rachel, went crazy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Gray found, by a medal that hung round
the infant’s neck, that her name was Mary Wallace;
and Mary Wallace she was called. She
appeared to be about a year old. She was a fine,
healthy child, and soon grew nicely, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gray were very fond of her; and William
called her his little sister, and taught her to
walk, and gave her more than half of all the
nice things he had—(they did not have sugarplums
and candy then, but children were better
off without them, and a great deal more healthy)—and
he would tell her pretty stories, and drag
her in his little wagon; and he loved her dearly.
She was a sweet-tempered and lovely child, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>very seldom did any thing to displease her parents;
and when she did she would grieve very
much, and she never could be happy till she was
forgiven. When she was twelve years old, there
was not a fairer or lovelier child in the whole
Providence Plantations, than Mary Wallace. Her
eyes were bright and blue; her long, light brown
hair fell in beautiful curls upon her shoulders,
and her voice had such a sweet and happy tone,
and her countenance such an amiable expression,
that the young loved her without envy, and the
old never passed her without a blessing. The
lark did not rise earlier than Mary Wallace. The
first thing in the morning she would be seen with
a basket on her arm, tripping lightly over the
grass, with her little white feet scattering the
dew, and singing sweetly and merrily as the
birds themselves. No one in the Plantations had
not felt her kindness; she always had an arm
for the aged—some little delicacy for the sick—tears
for the suffering—songs and smiles for the
happy—and bread, and beer, and pity, even for
the poor Indian. In short, the good people of the
Plantations believed, that, by a special mercy of
Divine Providence, she had been sent among
them. She was of great assistance to her parents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>They believed that they could not do without her.
In the spring she helped plant the corn and beans—weeded
the vegetable beds in the garden—and,
through all the warm season, she drove home
the cows at night—fed the sheep and pigs—and
took care of the hens, ducks, geese, and their little
ones. In the summer she gathered berries and
laid in herbs for winter. In autumn she helped
harvest the corn—gathered the dry beans and
peas, and did a great many other useful things;
and in the winter she sat, for the most part, by the
fireside, knitting stockings for the family, and
mending her own and William’s clothes—or she
read the Bible, of a long Sabbath evening, to her
father and mother: she was never idle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary never knew, till she was ten years old,
but that she was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Gray. At this time her mother thought best to
inform her how she had been brought to them.
She was grieved, at first, and cried very hard;
but she could not comprehend how it was possible
that they who had watched her—nursed her—loved
and supported her from earliest infancy,
should not be her own father, and mother, and
brother; and, instead of indulging childish curiosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>respecting her real parents, she treated the
whole as an unpleasant story, and strove to forget
it; and, with her sweet, happy disposition, she
was not long in doing this; and very soon she
smiled as sweetly—and sang as merrily—and
danced as gaily over the meadows, as she had
done before. About this time a distressing war
broke out, called ‘King Philip’s War;’ and the
times were more distressing than you, my dear
children, can well imagine. There is no correct
history of those times; but the most considerable
account you will find in Captain ‘Church’s History
of Philip’s War.’ The Indians, when they
took any of the white people prisoners, treated
them very cruelly; and, sometimes, put them to
death with great torture.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve read all about that, and I don’t blame the
Indians at all!” said George Gray, starting to his
feet with much earnestness, while his eyes almost
flashed fire; “what right had the white people
to come here and cheat them—and rob them of
their lands—and drive them from their houses?
Philip was a noble fellow! If I had lived then I
would have been on his side—at any rate—<i>I
would</i>!!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“And, brother,” said Ann, catching some of
his warmth, “don’t you remember what our last
fourth of July orator said of Philip?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” returned George, quickly, “these were
his very words: ‘Philip, the hero of Mount Hope,
though a savage, was a man—and a <i>noble man</i>—and
had he lived in other times and other circumstances,
he might have been a Cæsar—an
Alexander—a Napoleon:—and what is saying
more, and the most that can be said of any man—a
Washington!’” and the boy walked the room
quickly, while his burning cheek and flashing eye
told that his spirit was getting too strong for his
young bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will not dispute now whether the English
or the Indians were right or wrong,” said the
prudent grandmother. “Doubtless they were
both to blame. Well, when Mary Wallace was
about ten years old, and her brother fifteen, Mr.
Gray and William went to join the forces of Captain
Church. Mary it was who buckled on their
knapsacks and pinned their collars on the morning
of their first departure. She would not have cried
a single tear if she could have avoided it, because
her mother was so much distressed; but it was
such a dreadful thing to see them going away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and to think they might never return, that poor
Mary sobbed and wept as if her heart was breaking;
and when they said ‘farewell, Mary!’ her
heart was so full she could not speak; and when
they stepped from the threshold, poor Mary hid
her face in her mother’s lap, because she could
not bear to see them go. But after she had wept
a while, Mrs. Gray wiped away her tears and
got the Bible and bade her read; and they were
comforted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every morning and evening Mary Wallace
knelt by her little bedside and prayed to God for
the safe return of her father and brother. They
came home occasionally, but for the space of two
years they were gone most of the time. They
met, however, with no serious accident; and
Mary and her mother had much reason to be
thankful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One pleasant day during the second summer
of the war, Mary had taken her little basket, and
calling Hunter, a large dog, she went to gather
berries; but, not finding the fruit plenty, she
wandered farther into the woods than she should
have done at that dangerous time. She was
very busy picking some nice large berries, which
she had found in great abundance, when, presently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>she thought she heard a groan; and,
without waiting to think there might be danger,
she swung her basket on her arm and skipped
through the bushes, followed by Hunter. Very
soon she saw a large Indian seated upon a flat
rock and leaning against a tree behind him,
with a tomahawk and a bundle of arrows laid
at his side. Almost any little girl would have
been frightened, and have run away crying;
and, indeed, Mary Wallace herself felt that
it might be wrong to approach him when she
thought of her poor, lone mother; and she was
just going to turn back and run home with all her
might, when she saw that the poor man was pale
and faint, and could not sit upright but for the
tree against which he leaned. But what, in
reality, could Mary have to fear? She was known
to most of the tribes around, very few of whom
had not, at some time or other, felt her kindness.
Her little room was decorated with numerous
tokens of Indian gratitude, in the shape of wampum
belts and baskets, curious shells and stones,
and many other things; and the Indians called
her ‘the child of Sunshine’—‘the Flower’—‘the
Lily,’ and many other endearing names;
but mostly, ‘the Bird of Peace.’ Instead of running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>away, as she had at first thought to do, Mary
drew near the Indian and saw that he was asleep,
or had fainted from loss of blood, which was flowing
fast from a large wound in his leg. The
sight of blood naturally made Mary feel sick and
dizzy; but, without hesitation, she took a little
shawl from her neck and bound it round the limb.
The dog, as soon as he smelt the blood, began to
bark furiously; and this, together with the pain
caused by binding the wound, aroused the Indian,
who, thinking, probably, that the enemy had fallen
upon him, clenched his tomahawk and uttered a
fearful cry. Mary trembled an instant, as if she
already felt the blow; but she saw that he was
still very faint; and, taking courage, she caught
his arm and said, in the Indian tongue, ‘Fear not,
father, it is Mary!’ and as he looked upon her,
she pointed to the limb which she had nearly
bandaged. He appeared very grateful when he
saw what she had done, but he was too weak and
faint to say much; and he only whispered, as he
placed his hand on the child’s head, ‘Welcome,
daughter of Heaven!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Mary then ran home as fast as she could,
and told her mother about the poor wounded man,
and asked her for some food; and her mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>gave her some new milk, and some beer, and
bread. Mrs. Gray went out with her and carried
a blanket to cover him; and she bound up the
wound better than Mary could, putting on some
healing balsam. They persuaded him to partake
of the food; and, afterward, assisted him to a
shelter under a rock, where they left him quite
comfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The next day Mary asked permission to go
and carry food to the sick Indian; and, calling
Hunter, she took the basket her mother gave her,
and went to the woods. When she arrived at
the rock she found that the sick man had risen
and was seated on the top of the rock; and by
his side an Indian woman, who was caressing
him with much affection. Little Mary had come
quite near before they saw her; for she stepped
very lightly; but as soon as the old man did perceive
her, he said in English, ‘Behold the Bird
of Peace!’ As he spoke the woman looked
earnestly at Mary for several minutes, and then
she cried out, ‘My lily! my blossom! my babee!’
and, springing from the rock, she caught the child
in her arms and almost suffocated her with tears
and caresses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Mary alarmed and strangely agitated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>whispered, ‘Let me go home to my mother—do
let me go home!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thy mother!’ repeated the woman, ‘thy
own mother is gone across the wide waters, far
to the rising sun—and thy father,’ she pointed
up to heaven, ‘it is twice five summers since thy
father went to the hunting grounds of the paleface—he
died—he was murdered; and so was
my own little blossom—my own babe!’ Her
voice was choked—she could not speak any
more—her eyes grew burning and wild—her
features quivered, and she shook so fearfully that
Mary was frightened, and tried to get from her
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Namoina,’ said the old man, ‘the daughter
of Anawon must not be a coward.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“This appeal had the desired effect—she dashed
the few burning tears from her eyelids, and
bending a moment before her father, she rose up
again with a calm brow, that told not of the
struggle in her heart; and, taking Mary again in
her arms, she kissed her, and said a great many
tender and affectionate things to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Shall I never see my mother?’ asked the
child, mournfully; ‘has she forgotten me?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Forget thee, my flower! Does the mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>ever forget the child that has fed from her bosom!’
Again she was terribly distressed. After a few
minutes she held the child up toward heaven and
said, ‘The Great Spirit of thy fathers keep thee—and
bless thee!’ then setting her down again, she
resumed her former seat on the rock and began
picking up the pebbles around her and counting
them; but no entreaty or endearment could draw
a single word or look from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary saw Anawon partake of some of the
food she had brought him, and, leaving the remainder,
she took her basket and returned home
for the first time in her life really unhappy; and
for the first time in her life she did not open her
whole heart to her mother. Mrs. Gray, however,
observed that her cheek was flushed, and thought
she must have taken cold; and when it was about
sunset she persuaded her to go to bed. Mary
was glad to be where no one could notice or disturb
her feelings; so, kissing her good mother,
she went to her room, and knelt down by her
little bed and said her evening prayers. Very
soon she heard voices; and then she knew that
her father and brother had come; and just as
she was going to rise from her bed and dress,
for the purpose of seeing them, she heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>William say that they had got on the track of
old Anawon,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and that he believed he was not
far hence, probably out toward Seekonk; and
that they had better take whatever nourishment
could be had and be after him directly. Mrs.
Gray said nothing of the wounded Indian in the
woods; and when William said he must go in
and give his sister one kiss, she said, ‘Do not go
to-night, my son, for the child has a bad cold and
I am really afraid she will take the fever; and
if she knows you are come she will not sleep
another wink to-night for joy.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“At any other time, indeed, Mary would have
been overjoyed to see them—but now she was
thinking only of the poor Indian, and that he
might be killed; and, in her distress, she could
not help thinking that men were very cruel and
very wicked to wish to murder each other. After
bearing her anxiety of mind as long as she could,
she resolved to go herself, if she could steal from
the house unperceived, and warn the Indian of his
danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘That was right!’ exclaimed both the boys at
once.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“That was right!” echoed Ann.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I could have seen that girl!” said
George Gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think we have some good girls among us,”
said Henry Jackson, with a kind look at his cousin
Ann.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” said the grandmother, who noticed
and applauded that look, “very true; though few

<p class='c011'>“But to return to Mary. She rose and dressed
herself very quickly; and wrapping a little blanket
about her, she fell on her knees a moment,
and prayed God to keep her from all harm, and
to forgive her for leaving the house without her
parents’ knowledge; for Mary was a very obedient
and faithful child; and this was the first
time she had ever done any important thing without
the consent and approbation of her parents.
She opened a door which led from her little room
into a narrow entry, and passed, without observation,
into the open air. The moon was nearly at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the full. Heavy and rich masses of clouds were
continually floating over its surface, and, sometimes,
almost obscuring its light; but then they
would pass away, and the moon would shine out
brighter than before; and the waters of the river
flashed like diamonds; and all the leaves of the
wilderness, as they waved in the stirring wind,
shone as if they had been dipped in molten silver.
Mary clapped her little hands and forgot to be
afraid, for her spirit was worshipping that God
who maketh night so very glorious.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now let me tell you, my children, a good
child never need be afraid in the darkness more
than in the open day; for, as the Scriptures say,
‘He knoweth all the lambs of his fold;’ and again,
‘A sparrow falleth not to the ground without his
knowledge.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The way was familiar to Mary, and soon she
came to the rock where she had left Anawon.
When her steps were heard, the old chief started
to his feet and uttered a low cry, and, directly,
several Indians stood by his side. Mary was
not afraid, even then; for though the Indians
were the enemies of her nation and her kindred,
they were not her enemies—they were her
friends: for there was hardly one among them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>who had not, at some time or other, felt the kindness
of the sweet child. So she walked directly
into the midst, fearless of the tomahawks that were
lifted at her approach, and holding up her little
hand to Anawon, said, in her low, sweet voice,
‘Father—fly—thy enemy is at hand!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The old Indian seemed, at first, almost
choked with emotion; for he well knew that
his enemies were the friends of Mary; and laying
his hand on the child’s head as she bent
before him, he only said, ‘The God of the white
man and the Great Spirit of the Indian be with
thee!’ and his followers, who, from the moment
she was known, had fallen back from the centre
of the rock, as they leaned upon their bows and
looked upon the child, repeated, at once, a word
in the Indian tongue, which was as much as to
say, ‘Amen.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then Anawon unbound a wampum bracelet
from his arm, and giving it to Mary, said, ‘Daughter!
in the hour of sorrow bring this to Anawon;
and ask what thou wilt, and it shall not be denied
thee!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then Namoina (whom we will henceforth
call Rachel) took the child in her arms and kissed
her, and wrapped her little blanket about her;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and Mary ran swiftly toward home. She
reached her room in safety, and soon she fell
asleep, for she was very tired. Soon after this
Mrs. Gray came into the room, and saw that Mary
was asleep, and that her pillow was wet with
tears; she could not think what had caused them,
for she had never known Mary to be very unhappy.
Just at this moment William came in on
tiptoe; and, as he bent down to kiss his sister’s
cheek, he saw the bracelet, which had fallen to
the floor, and examining it by the light of the
moon, he thought he had seen it before; and
taking it to his father, Mr. Gray said that he remembered
it very well, for he had seen it on the
arm of Anawon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I will wake Mary instantly,’ said William,
‘and perhaps she can tell us where he is; and
we will have the cunning old savage before
morning!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thou art much too hasty,’ said Mr. Gray,
laying a hand on his son’s arm; ‘this token was
given to thy sister in peace and love. Thou
knowest boy,’ he continued, with difficulty restraining
his son, ‘thou knowest the child’s heart
would be broken, if she were obliged, in any way,
to be made an instrument of evil. Alas!’ he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>added, giving way to the natural tenderness of
his heart, ‘alas! that we are compelled, by cruel
necessity, to slay, ay, murder each other!’ and
Simon Gray folded his dark, bony hands upon his
breast and was silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Observing the boy still unsatisfied, he said,
‘Go to thy rest, my son; the Lord in his own good
time will do the work. At all events, if I can
prevent it, blood shall never fall upon the head of
Mary.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The next morning by dawn of day, father and
son departed. Mary was not awake, for she
had been so tired that she slept very soundly;
and William was just allowed to kiss her cheek
<i>very</i> softly, and deposite by her side some little
baskets of willow; and he then embraced his
weeping mother and hastened to join his father,
who already stood by the gate waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Mary awoke, she was so much disappointed
because they were gone, that she could
hardly keep from crying; but she saw that her
mother was striving to be cheerful, so she wiped
the few tears that fell upon her cheek, and folding
her arms round her neck, she whispered softly,
‘Let us pray to God, mother, and he will comfort
us.’ And they both knelt down and prayed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and when they rose up they were quite calm; for
God never withholds a blessing from those who
seek in humility of soul, and never withdraws
his countenance from those who trust in him.
And now, my children, I beg you to remember,
whatever may be your trials and distresses, always
to put your trust in God, and nothing will
have power to harm you; but do not think, my
children, that you must wait till distresses <i>come</i>—seek
the love of God in the day of joy—and in
the hour of sorrow he will not be far off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But to return to my story. Two months had
passed away and Mr. Gray and William had not
returned, though Mrs. Gray had heard from them
occasionally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a bright afternoon in September, and
Mary had taken her knitting-work and was sitting
beside her mother’s arm-chair at the door of their
cottage; but she could not work, for her eyes
were continually wandering off in the direction
of the Seekonk road; and, at every waving of the
trees, or the least unusual sound, she would start
from her seat, and say, ‘They are coming!’ and
then run to make some addition, or alteration, to
the furniture of a small round table, white as snow
which was spread with bowls and spoons, brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>bread and baked apples, and a pan of new milk;
and then, returning to the door, she would expect
to find them near; but when she looked in every
direction, she saw only the few quiet looking
houses of the Plantation—the wide and almost
unbroken forest, and the broad road before her—but
no father or brother. She had repeated this
act several times, and at each successive one
she was more sure that they were coming; until,
at last, the continued disappointment was more
than she could bear; and, clinging round her
mother’s neck, she burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Gray and William had sent word, by
some men belonging to the town, that they should
be at home the night before, and they had not
come. Might not some terrible accident have
happened?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Gray had been sitting silently, with her
arms folded upon her breast, struggling within
herself to bear the approaching trial as became a
Christian; for she knew better than Mary did
how full of disappointment life is, and she knew
also that the times were peculiarly uncertain and
hazardous. She had appeared calm, notwithstanding,
for she did not wish to check the fond
anticipations of Mary; but when she saw that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>even she could not hope any longer—when she
felt the sweet child weeping upon her breast, for
an instant her calmness forsook her, and she wept
with Mary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Do <i>you</i> believe, mother, they will not come?’
sobbed the child; ‘do <i>you</i> believe they will not
come to-night?’ And shaking away the curls from
her face, and a flood of tears with them, she
looked upon her mother as if she would read her
thoughts before she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘They will come, my child,’ said Mrs. Gray,
speaking with much difficulty; ‘they will come
when it is God’s pleasure;’ and putting the child
from her arms, she went to her room and shut
herself in, for her distress was so great that she
could not bear to have Mary see it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child, being left to herself, wept without
restraint; but still she did not actually believe
that her father and brother would not come very
soon, and she dried her tears and thought she
would run out a little way on the Seekonk road,
and perhaps she might meet them. When she
had got a little way from the house she saw a
person approaching, and she hastened along,
hoping to hear something of her father and
brother; and when she got near she saw it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Rachel. Mary was very glad, for she had not
seen Rachel for a long time, and she knew
the Indian woman was a good friend to her,
so she ran toward her and put her little arms
around her; but her heart was so full she
could not speak. Rachel did not know her at
first; but when she saw that it was Mary, she
held her in her arms, repeating, all the while,
some words in the Indian tongue, which Mary
knew were a kind of thanksgiving to the Great
Spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Child, I was seeking thee!’ she said, at last,
in imperfect English; ‘I have bad news—thy
brother is fallen among his enemies!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Will not my brother come home?’ said the
child, bursting into tears; ‘will he never come
home? Is he dead?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘He is yet alive,’ replied Rachel, ‘but his
hours are counted. This night he is to die!’’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Where is he? Let me go to him!’ said the
child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It was for that very purpose I came to thee.
For thy sake he may yet live—he is in the hands
of Anawon.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘O, let us go this instant! Let us run! Let
us fly!’ said Mary, seizing the hand of Rachel;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>and she ran forward a few steps—then, stopping
short, she said, ‘I must run back and tell mother;
I cannot go without telling her!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thou must not go back,’ said Rachel; ‘let
her not know his danger till it is over—if thy
brother lives, we will return with the earliest
light; if he dies, it will be soon enough to break
her heart—as mine is broken,’ she added, beating
her breast, while her eyes shone like fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I cannot go,’ sobbed Mary, ‘I cannot go without
telling mother.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Then thy brother will die!’ said Rachel;
‘then he will die—they are singing the death-song!
The fire is kindling now!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘O let us go then!’ said the child, with a
piercing cry, ‘let us hurry! let us go!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The pledge of Anawon, is it about thee,
child?’ asked Rachel; and Mary drew from her
pocket the bracelet of the chief; and they went
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their way lay directly through the woods.
Mary’s poor, little, bare feet, were dreadfully
scratched with the briers; and she was so tired
with running, and hurrying, and crying, that
sometimes Rachel was obliged to take her up and
carry her. At length it grew very dark; and, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>first, Mary could hardly tell where to step; but
when she got used to it she did not mind it at all—for
she was not thinking of herself, but of her
father, and mother, and brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After they had gone several miles they saw a
light at a great distance: and, when they came
near, they saw it was a large fire—and when
they got still nearer, they saw a great many Indians,
with painted faces and tomahawks in their
hands, dancing about it, singing, and shouting,
and uttering terrible cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of the Indians, who was stationed to keep
watch, saw little Mary and her guide; and as
soon as he knew Rachel he shouted ‘Namoina!’
And all immediately rested their tomahawks on
the ground, and, ceasing to sing and dance, they
awaited her approach with all the respect due to
the daughter of so mighty a chief as Anawon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary Wallace saw but one thing. As the
ring opened she beheld her brother standing in
the midst, beside a large pile of light fuel, which
was all ready to be kindled; his hands were
bound behind him and his head was bent down.
Mary gave one spring, and, fearing not the terrible
looking men around her, she bounded to the
side of William; and clinging round his neck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>she sobbed as if her little heart was breaking.
William was pale as death when he saw Mary.
A few hot tears fell on his cheek; but he spoke
not; he bowed his head upon her neck awhile—and
then his heart was melted—and he sobbed
aloud. This relieved him, and he whispered,
‘Sister, wipe my tears away and leave me—thou
must not see me die.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Thou wilt not die! Thou shalt not!’ said
Mary, wringing her hands; and, losing all fear,
but that of her brother’s death, she ran wildly
from one to another crying out, ‘Will my brother
die? must William die?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anawon, who sat apart on a rock higher than
those around, saw and heard the tumult; but he
knew not its cause; and, in a deep and somewhat
angry tone of voice, he gave orders for the
noise to be hushed, and the awful ceremonies of
death to be resumed. In an instant the place
was still—and then a low murmur ran among the
crowd, ‘The Child of Sunrise!’—‘The Bird of
Peace!’—‘The Red Man’s Friend!’ and such
was the strong love Mary had excited among the
Indians, that, for a moment, not a hand was lifted,
even at the command of their chief—then slowly
they prepared to obey.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“As Mary’s almost distracted features were
turned to the glaring light of the death-fire, Anawon
saw her; and the long, deep, agonizing groan
he did not try to suppress, told that she was recognized.
The next moment she was at his feet.
The bracelet was clasped about his arm. ‘Father,
will he die!’ was all that she could speak; and
poor little Mary fainted away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anawon took the child in his own arms, and
administered something which revived her; and
when he saw her beautiful blue eyes again, he
wiped the heavy drops of sweat from his brow,
and gave orders for the release of the prisoner.
Mary was then almost wild with joy—and she
laughed and wept—and sang and danced—and
ran from one to another—and they feared she
would go into fits; but in a few minutes she was
completely exhausted; and Rachel took her in
her arms and held her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“William wanted to go home immediately, because
he knew his parents would be very much
distressed about their children. One of the Indians
said he would carry little Mary in his arms, and,
accompanied by Rachel, they set out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was about sunrise when they came in
sight of Providence; and just then they met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Simon Gray, at the head of a small band of men,
going out in pursuit of his children. He was very
much overcome at meeting them so unexpectedly;
and he forgot not to fall on his knees and bless
God for their restoration. Then he embraced
them affectionately, and learned the particulars
of their escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During this time the men ran on before to
the settlement and told the news; and as they
entered the town the people came running out of
their houses, all uttering expressions of joy, and
blessing God for their happy deliverance. But
the mother’s heart was most severely tried. She
had given them up, and had become almost calm;
but when the news of their safe return reached
her, her agitation was so great that she fell into
fits; and from their effect she never recovered.
She lingered, however, in a weak state nearly a
year; and then she took an epidemic fever and
died; and Mary Wallace was once more—an
orphan!</p>

<p class='c011'>“During this time the poor Indians were mostly
subdued. King Philip was killed; Anawon was
taken by Captain Church, and, during the absence
of that good man, was shamefully put to death.
Mary was much distressed, and refused to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>comforted, when she heard of the cruel death of
her good old friend, (though William often told
her that the white people never could be safe
while he lived,) and when she was alone she
would weep at thinking of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One day, a short time after her mother’s
death, she went to visit a friend about five or six
miles from the Plantation; and in the afternoon
she walked out alone, thinking she would go and
see the rock where Philip and his men had once
concealed themselves. She soon found the place;
for the main rock, which the Indians called Quinsniket,
or Rock-house, was larger than, and different
from, all others around. This rock projects
over to the southwest, and under that side of it the
Indians had found a home. Mary went there and
examined the place, and she found a great many
arrow-spikes made of flint, and some pieces of
wampum; and the ashes of their fires were still
visible. She then climbed to the top of the rock,
and sat down under the shade of a tall sugar-maple;
and there she could not help thinking how
cruel it was for the poor Indians to be killed or
driven from their lands, and their houses, and their
fathers’ graves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As she was returning, a little way from Quinsniket,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>she saw a woman sitting on a flat stone,
in the midst of a square where the earth seemed
to have been blackened with fire, and where the
grass had never since grown. When Mary came
nearer, she saw that it was Rachel. Overjoyed,
she was just going to spring to her arms, for she
had not seen her friend since the morning of her
brother’s release, when she saw the poor creature
was weeping. As soon as Rachel saw Mary, she
hid her head in her blanket. The child looked
at her a moment sorrowfully, then springing to
her lap she folded her little arms round her neck,
and putting her soft cheek close to hers, wept with
her. This act of tenderness softened Rachel; and
wiping away her own tears with a corner of her
blanket, she held up the child and gazed mournfully
upon her face; then she said, ‘Weep on,
my daughter! weep on!—for thy tears are cool
and pleasant; but mine—O! they are drops of
fire!’ Then she spoke of her father’s death and
the downfall of her race, till her voice was choked—and
she wept like a heart-broken child. Again
she was silent, and began to pluck the blades of
grass and weave them into basket-work, keeping
her face all the while turned from Mary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suddenly she looked upon the child, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>exclaimed, with much energy, ‘Here—here! on
this very spot ’twas done!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘What, mother? what was done’? asked
Mary, with a trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘My babe—my babe!’ Rachel could say no
more for an instant; and then she added, ‘I will
tell thee: Namoina was the daughter of a mighty
chief; many chiefs sought her in marriage—but
she said, “No!” for her heart beat quick only at
the step of Mohaton the brave. Anawon, the
great chief, said, “Go!” and Namoina took the
hand of Mohaton, and went from her father. We
had one babe—it was beautiful and dear—and
it went as quick from my arms as the blossom
from the corn-leaf. The white man came—Mohaton
fell by our own door! and my babe—they
trod upon it! It saw me—it tried to lift its little
arms—it tried to open its little eyes—it could
not. I took it in my arms—it was cold—still—dead.
I saw not that all my brethren had gone—I
saw not that I was alone. I held my little one
till night came and made everything as dark and
cold as my own bosom, and then I laid it in the
ground—here!’ As she spoke she stretched out
her hand, and rested it an instant on a little
mound beside her; then she stretched out her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>arms and fell upon it, and wept and groaned fearfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After a short time she arose, and dashing the
tears away from her cheek, she became terribly
calm, and continued: <a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a>‘At last the hope of vengeance
possessed me. I rose from this grave and
vowed to kill the first white child I could find.
I found thee, my child—I brought thee here—to
the very spot where my own darling bled; but
thy smile was so sweet—thy voice was so soft
and pitiful—thy little arms clung around my neck
so tenderly, I could not kill thee; and the spirit
of my little one whispered to me constantly, “Let
Mary lie in thy bosom and warm it again!” So
I kept thee, and when three moons<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> were gone,
it was cold, and thy little limbs trembled, and thy
cheek was blue. I saw that the child of the
Pale-face should not dwell in the wilderness. I
gave thee meal and corn; but the food of the
red babe was not for thee. I was afraid that
thou too wouldst die. I sought thy mother to
give thee up. She had gone, with her broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>heart, over the great waters.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Namoina knew
how to pity her. Thy father was slain in battle.
She was a motherless widow. On my way back
Simon Gray found me; and when I saw thee
among thy own people, I could not take thee
away. Thy smile was as the sunlight to me—thou
wert the only thing that made life pleasant,
and yet I left thee.’ She paused, and Mary hid
her face in the faithful creature’s bosom and wept
without restraint.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again she resumed—‘The mother I found thee
is gone, and now I will give thee back the other—thy
own!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Where? where?’ asked Mary, lifting her
hands quickly. ‘Where is my mother?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Be patient, and I will tell thee. Go to Seekonk
on the next day thy people meet to worship
the Great Spirit—I have promised to send thee—she
will be there; a tall woman, and slender and
graceful as a reed upon the hill-side. Her brow
is fair as the coming of light, fair as thy own, my
child: and her dark hair falleth over it as the
shadows of evening upon snow. There she is,’
continued Rachel, taking a small miniature from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>her own neck, and giving it to Mary, ‘some some cunning<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
man of thy people hath put her face here;
but not all. The kind look, and the tears, and
the sorrow are not here!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary took the picture and looked upon it,
and kissed it, and thanked God that again she
was not an orphan—that again she was to find a
mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Go,’ continued Rachel, ‘remember all I have
told thee; observe the scar over her left eye.
She will know thee by thy little playthings—by
thy sweet voice, and by thy father’s soft blue
eye.’ As she spoke she gave some little toys to
Mary, and then, motioning her away, she added,
in a thick and tremulous voice, ‘now go, and let
Namoina—die!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Die!’ repeated Mary, ‘Die! what can my
mother mean?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Come hither, child, at the rising of the sun,
and thou wilt know what I mean. Thrice hath
the sun risen and set since food hath passed the
lips of Namoina; and when she eateth again, it
will be among her fathers in the hunting-grounds
afar off.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“‘I will bring thee food and drink; I will go
now,’ said Mary, bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Go, but come not again! go, and return not!
Namoina will find it hard to die while the eye of
her nursling is upon her.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary sprang back again to the side of Rachel.
‘O, my mother!’ she said, ‘thy hands are cold,
and thy brow—what shall I do for thee? What
shall I do?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘If thou wilt not go, sit down at my feet and
listen to my death-song; but touch me not—speak
not, or the soul of Namoina will be a coward
and refuse to die.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary fell, rather than sat, down at the poor
creature’s feet, and listened to her with a bursting
heart. I will repeat the song to you, not exactly
as it was chanted by Namoina, but as it has since
been put into verse. It still, however, retains its
original spirit and meaning.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Her voice died away gently, till only a low
murmur was audible. The setting sun flashed a
moment over her features, and as it faded away,
they turned to a livid hue. She looked earnestly
at Mary, as if she would speak; her lips quivered
in the attempt just once; her head sank upon
her bosom; and when Mary threw her arms about
her, she knew, by the chill, that poor Namoina
was dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child sat down again at Namoina’s feet
and hid her face in her lap, and sobbed and wept
passionately. And there she sat till it was almost
dark; and there her friends, who, alarmed at her
absence, went in search of her, found her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They removed the body to the house, and
Mary watched by it through the night; and the
next day poor Namoina was decently buried.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Her funeral was respectably attended, and Mary
mourned for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the child was now awakened to new
hopes; she could think of nothing but her
mother. She was longing to see her, and yet she
was almost afraid; for she had loved her adopted
mother so dearly she thought she could not, perhaps,
like her own mother as well; and the
thought was distressing to her. But, between
the different agitations of hope and fear, the two
days that remained between the burial of her
Indian friend and the Sabbath, seemed to her the
longest days she had ever known. She had begged
her father’s permission for William to take
her to Seekonk on the next Sabbath, and he had
willingly granted her request; but she said nothing
of her hopes to her father or brother, from a delicate
regard for their feelings, because, at the best,
she knew it would distress them. They and the
dear departed one who had nursed and loved her
from infancy, had been so long all-in-all to her,
that her heart was reluctant, even in secrecy, to
cherish a hope independent of them. Then poor
Mary was perplexed by a thousand fears; she
thought that it might rain—or that her mother
might be sick—or that there might be some misunderstanding—or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that, perhaps, the whole was
but a raving fancy of Namoina—or if the whole
was true, (and this Mary firmly believed when
she looked in love upon the sweet features that
never left her bosom, but to be kissed and wept
upon,) a thousand unthought of difficulties might
occur. In short, her fears, and doubts, and anxieties,
were innumerable. She could neither take
food or rest, nor attend steadily to her daily occupations;
and she kept by herself as much as
possible, and spent most of her time in prayer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last the Sabbath came. It was a beautiful
October morning. The sun went up gloriously
and melted away the bright frost from the foliage;
and the forest—you have seen our woods in the
autumn, children, and you know how beautiful
they are when the frost has turned the leaves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Ann, “and do you remember the
lines upon ‘Autumn,’ you gave me the other day,
where the sweet poet we love so dearly, compares
our autumn foliage to ‘a flood of molten
rainbows?’ A beautiful thought—is it not, grandmother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True, my child,” said Mrs. Gray, turning an
affectionate glance to the bright eyes that were
lifted up; “but your brother and cousins, I see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>are more interested about the fate of Mary, than
the beauties of autumn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said it was a lovely morning, and Mary
would have thought so too at any other time; for
not even you, my dear Ann, have more poetry in
your heart, than Mary Wallace had. Her taste
was not cultivated, it is true; but the God of
nature had dealt bountifully by her. She never
looked on the beauties of creation without beholding
the Creator; and this spirit is one of the highest
and richest sources of poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, as I said, or was going to say, her mind
this morning was full of other thoughts; and she
could hardly have told even what season of the
year it was, though she loved the autumn dearly,
and its beauties were never before unmarked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She counted the toys Namoina had given her
over and over again, that she might be sure they
were all there; and then she put them into a
little bag with a medal she had worn in infancy;
and before William had begun to dress, or the
horse was brought to the door, she was quite
ready and waiting for him in the passage. She
thought William had never been so long in dressing
before; and she kept calling to him, and hurrying
him. Her father, wondering at her unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>impatience, stepped into the passage with a
thought to chide her; but she stood there—such a
beautiful, bright creature, that he could not; and
he paused and looked upon her in silence. The
excitement of her hopes had risen from her heart
to her face; the maple leaf was not richer than
the bloom upon her cheek, or the sunlight brighter
than the flashing of her eye. A short green mantle
hung from her shoulders, and her light, straw
grassy bonnet could not hide the luxury of her
brown hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As she lifted her head at the sound of foot
steps, the golden curls swept back from her face,
and as she looked upon her father her eye filled
with tears; and there was something in it that
made the heart of Simon Gray tremble. Mary
sprang to his arms and clinging round his neck,
wept; for she thought it was almost wrong to
seek another parent when she already had one
who loved her so very tenderly. But at the sound
of William’s footsteps on the stairs, she kissed
her father, and, wiping away her tears, was all
bloom and hope again; and William could not
help pausing to look at her, ere he bounded to the
saddle; and he thought she had never been so
beautiful before. But Mary trembled so she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>could not spring up behind him as usual; her
father was obliged to lift her; and when he felt
how she trembled, he feared she was ill, and
asked her to stay at home and not go to the meeting;
but Mary assured him she was perfectly
well; so the kind-hearted man could make no
other objection, and they rode off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They arrived at the meeting-house before any
others; and as the people began to gather to the
house, Mary trembled so she could hardly keep
her seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One after another came in—one after another
was examined; but poor Mary could not think
any one of them was her mother. At last a lady
came and sat nearly opposite Mary. The child’s
heart bounded; she saw the same dark hair and
eye—the same white brow—but, O! it had no
scar!—and tears of disappointment filled her eyes.
Another came; she was tall and graceful; she
had dark hair and eyes, and a very fair brow.
‘That is the one! That is my mother!’ thought
Mary, and she was just going to throw herself
into her arms and call her mother, when the lady—who
probably thought Mary very rude for staring
at her so fixedly—turned quickly away with
such an angry expression of countenance, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the child could hardly restrain her tears; and
then the idea that the lady might be her mother,
made her tremble. Others came, and were, in
turn, examined; but not one of them could be
compared with the picture she held in her hand—the
description given by Namoina—or the image
in the heart of Mary. The poor child was doomed
to be disappointed; and she sat down, and
leaned her head upon her hands, and thought she
would never hope again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A low murmur, as of one in prayer, reached
her ear. She lifted her eyes, almost unwillingly,
and on the opposite side of the room, she saw a
lady in deep mourning, kneeling before one of the
rough benches, in prayer. The garb of outward
grief was an unwonted sight there, and every eye
was turned upon her. Yet there was a kindly
expression in every face, for the people, although
their own simple creed and rigid habits forbade
the use of a peculiar garment as a sign of wo,
could not help respecting the piety of the stranger.
Mary’s heart beat wildly at the first glance, and
she turned very pale, and then again her face was
flushed with the fever of excited feelings. After
kneeling a short time, the stranger slowly rose,
and turned round upon the little assembly with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>melancholy, listless air. As she did so her face
turned full in Mary’s view; it was pale, and tender,
and sorrowful. The child became, at once,
convinced that her search was ended; in that one
glance she had seen all; the tall and graceful
form—the dark glossy hair—the fair, pale brow—the
scar—the resemblance to the picture—all that
she sought was there. She forgot every thing but
that she had found her long-lost parent; she flew
along the narrow aisle, and when she reached the
lady just whispered, ‘Mother!’ and fell into her
arms. The child had fainted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The strange lady seemed as much overcome
as Mary. She held her closely embraced in her
arms, and gazed eagerly upon her pallid features.
It chanced at this moment that the miniature fell
from Mary’s bosom, and the medal on which was
engraved her name. The stranger looked upon
them and uttered a faint scream; then she clasped
the child close to her heart; and when Mary
opened her blue eyes and smiled upon her, she
cried out, ‘I know thee now, my daughter!—my
own beloved daughter!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whole congregation had gathered round
with wondering looks and curious faces; and
even the good minister himself, instead of going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>to his desk, mingled with the crowd, and seemed
to enter into the spirit of the scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was one powerfully interested; William
had followed Mary from her seat, wondering
at her strange behavior; but from the moment
when he saw that she had found her own mother,
he stood with his arms folded upon his breast, the
only silent one among the crowd.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simon Gray was immediately sent for, and it
was established, beyond the possibility of doubt,
that Mary had indeed found a mother, and Mrs.
Wallace a long-lost daughter; and the minister
offered up a solemn public thanksgiving to God
for their re-union.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The children thanked their grandmother for
telling them such a very interesting story, and
little Helen danced with joy, she was so glad that
Mary had found her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have one more wish to be gratified, grandmother,”
said George Gray; “I should like to go
to Quinsniket and see the place where Philip and
his followers were sheltered, and where Namoina
died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your wish shall be indulged, my dear boy,”
said Mrs. Gray. “When the spring opens, I will
take you all to pass a few weeks in the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and we will go to Quinsniket. You will find
many traces of the Indians still existing, in the
names of different localities, and in the recollections
of the ancient inhabitants. The field where
they planted their corn, still called Indian oldfield,
is to be seen a short distance from Quinsniket;
and the rock itself, so intimately connected
with the history of a fallen but once mighty race,
still remains, as it were, a monument to designate
their grave. The spot where poor Namoina was
buried, is now within the limits of a little town.
Her hut was afterward rebuilt by a few wandering
remnants of her tribe, and some of the present
inhabitants remember it. The hearth-stone is still
to be seen; and over it waves a honey-locust tree,
which a distinguished gentleman, since dead, planted
to mark the spot where stood <span class='fss'>THE LAST WIGWAM</span>.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CONDY O’NEAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Welcome to Wheatland!” cried I, one fine
autumnal evening, seeing my old friend, Captain
Evans, approaching my door. “You are a bad
paymaster in the article of visits,” I continued,
handing him an arm-chair. “Here have I been
living fifteen years, visiting you half a dozen times
a year, and receiving nothing but fruitless promises
of a return for my civilities: but here you are at
last, and right welcome to your ancient hall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, aye,” replied the Captain. “Every
year, and every month, since leaving this, have I
determined that you should have me for your
guest; but, I know not how it happened, that each
day seemed to bring forth a trouble, or an occupation,
at least, sufficient for itself. But here I
am at last; and, as Tom is at length out of the
way, I mean to be at my ease here, and billet
myself upon you for a month at the least.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Evans was a hardy old “revolutioner,”
nearly seventy years of age, but hale and stout,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and as active as most men of forty. The farm
on which I resided had been the property of his
father, and the Captain had passed the greater portion
of his life upon it. Inheriting the farm upon
the death of his father, the Captain continued to
reside on it until the time of my purchasing it
from him. His only daughter having been left a
widow, with four sons, as yet young, he, at her
request, sold the farm, and went to reside with her
in another part of the country, devoting himself
to the care of his grandchildren and the management
of his daughter’s estate. Here I had frequently
visited him, and received many an unfulfilled
promise of a return in kind to my visits.
He had at length taken the opportunity, when the
youngest of his grandsons was sent to college, to
pay me the long deferred visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning following his arrival my guest
was, according to his wont, astir very early, and
before breakfast was announced we had rambled
over the greater part of the farm; each well-remembered
spot eliciting its anecdote from my
communicative friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the evening we again walked abroad; and,
having followed the windings of the creek to its
junction with the Schuylkill, we seated ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>upon the mouldering trunk of a gigantic, fallen
button-wood tree. The bank of the stream was
here about twenty feet in height, and descended
perpendicularly to the water, which was very
deep. Toward the opposite side the water shoaled,
and was bordered by a low, muddy shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This,” said I, after a short pause in the conversation,
“has been a magnificent tree.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Captain laughed, and said, rather suddenly,
“Do you remember Condy O’Neal, a little Irishman,
who formerly lived in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have but a faint recollection of the man; he
has been dead many a year since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This tree has recalled to my mind a droll adventure
of Condy’s, in which the tree bore a part.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Condy came into the county about the year
1770, and opened a school. He was a true son
of Erin, fond of fun, the bottle, and the girls, and
seemed to have been, by nature, designed for
amusement. He was a short, fat, little mortal,
with a bald patch on his carroty poll; his face
was flat and nearly square, his mouth was large,
and puckered with a smile of habitual drollery,
and his little gray eyes twinkled like those of a
cat. No one had ever seen Condy looking sad;
and he never spoke but to excite a smile by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>humor or his bulls. Withal he was by no means
touchy, and could laugh very heartily at a joke
even at his own expense. But it was among the
girls that his powers were most fully displayed;
no professor of blarney could outshine Condy in
the art of flattery. When in the society of the
fair, Condy’s eloquence was unbounded: the torrent
of compliments, jokes, and blunders flowed
with unpausing rapidity. It is, therefore, not to
be wondered at that he became a leading man in
conversation, and that our country beau, one and
all, felt themselves below par in his presence.
Condy was not slow to remark this, and infinite
was the pleasure he took in teasing them as often
as opportunity offered. No sooner did he observe
a beau looking particularly tender at one of the
lasses, than Condy took upon himself to cut him
out; and many an evening has he thus consumed
in wronging a poor dog of a lover.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The man whom Condy chiefly delighted to
torment was a young farmer, named John Bingaman,
a man of great stature and prodigious
strength—the hero of all the broils and boxing-matches
in the country. These boxing-matches
are now out of fashion, but at the time of which
I am speaking, they were very common; each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>county having one or more champions, who often
tried their prowess against those of the neighboring
counties. In these contests John had never
yet found his match; and his temper had, in consequence,
become so proud and overbearing, as to
render him an object of dislike to all his acquaintance.
John’s air of superiority was intolerable
to Condy. He felt himself to be John’s superior
in all but brute force; and was grieved to think
that so thick-skulled a mortal should be at all
noticed by the side of a man of mind like Condy
O’Neal. On the other hand, John was equally
chagrined by the deference paid to so diminutive
a creature as Condy. He was perpetually galled
by Condy’s remarks on the superiority of mind
over muscle—of wit over strength. He felt that
his former influence was sadly impaired; and how
to re-establish it, was beyond his contrivance. To
attempt to pick a quarrel with Condy and flog him,
would, he was aware, be useless; for, in the first
place, Condy was too well acquainted with his
rival’s bodily powers to risk a battle; and, secondly,
Condy’s superiority, resting in his wit, could
not be beaten out of him by kicks and cuffs. John,
therefore, concluded that it would be best to bear
Condy’s presence with patience; certain that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>roving disposition natural to school-masters must,
ere long, remove the evil from his sight. In the
mean time, however, he resolved to wreak his
vengeance by playing all manner of boorish practical
jokes upon Condy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One evening, late in autumn, Condy, John, and
a number more, found themselves assembled at a
husking frolic, where John, whose Dulcinea was
of the party, exerted himself to the utmost to get
the better of Condy; and, by dint of tripping up
his heels and then burying him beneath a huge
heap of corn-husks, or pushing him headlong
over a row of lasses seated at their work, he contrived
to keep the laughers on his own side.
Condy bore all this with his characteristic good
humor, until, the business of the evening having
been nearly completed, and his scheme of vengeance
matured, he suddenly assumed the air of
a man whose patience is exhausted, and let fall a
menace of revenge. Irritated by such a speech
from a man like Condy, John roughly seized him
by the shoulder, and demanded to know what he
was threatening. ‘What I may never be able to
undo,’ replied Condy, gravely. ‘And what may
that be?’ asked John. ‘Why, Mister Bingaman,
I could clap a horse’s head upon your shoulders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and that is more than I could take off again.’
John burst into an outrageous fit of laughter, and
dared Condy to the trial. ‘No! no!’ said Condy,
‘I don’t want to do you an injury. I could easily
put a horse’s head upon you, but if I should do
so, there it must stick as long as you live: I could
not take it off.’ ‘Try your best,’ again cried John;
‘I am not afraid of you.’ ‘Well, well,’ replied
Condy, ‘as you doubt my ability, I’ll just do something
for a small bit that shall harm no one, and
convince you of the truth of what I said about
the horse’s head. Now, John, strong as you are,
I will undertake to make a cat pull you across
that creek by a rope. Will you bet me a joe
upon it?’ ‘Done,’ cried John; ‘post your joe.’
The money was regularly staked, when Condy,
turning to the company, requested them to adjourn
to the farm-house, where he would presently join
them, in order to make some necessary preparations.
Condy went to his school-room, which was
not very far off, and in a few minutes returned,
bearing a sheet of paper, a pencil, a pair of dividers,
and a Gunter’s scale. Entering the house,
he found the company very merry upon the occasion.
At first, all was laughter and jesting at
Condy’s expense; but he, nothing moved thereby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>seated himself with the most imperturbable gravity
by the side of a table; while John, with a grin of
anticipated triumph on his visage, seated himself
opposite and watched his motions. Condy pored
intently upon his scale, then adjusted his dividers
upon it, and proceeded to draw three concentric
circles upon the paper. In the central
circle he wrote <span class='sc'>John Bingaman</span>, and within the
two outer he drew a number of strange figures of
animals, birds, insects, etc. During this process,
which was conducted with great solemnity and
extreme slowness, John’s phiz gradually lost its
comic expression, and assumed a dolorous cast.
The whole company caught the infection of solemnity,
and, to noise and merriment, there succeeded
a silence so dead, that the sound of Condy’s pencil
was distinctly audible as it slowly passed over
the paper. Having now tickled his audience to
the proper point, Condy arose, and, in a solemn
tone, said, ‘John Bingaman!’ John rose from
his seat with a visage rueful as his who drew
King Priam’s curtains in the night, to tell him
that his warlike son was dead. ‘John Bingaman!’
Condy repeated, ‘put your finger upon
this magic circle and acknowledge it for your
hand and seal.’ Spite of his natural intrepidity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>John’s superstitious fears had completely
overpowered him, and he stood gazing upon
Condy, while his knees almost smote together
with apprehension. ‘John Bingaman!’ again said
Condy, ‘do you refuse to acknowledge this to be
your hand and seal?’ John muttered something
unintelligibly. ‘Well,’ said Condy, ‘then the bet
is lost—the joe is mine.’ The idea of so easily
parting with his joe, and the fear of the ridicule
which began already to manifest itself in the
titters of the company, recalled John from his
stupor, and, hastily clapping his finger upon the
fatal circle, he said, ‘This is my hand and seal,
confound you!—now make what you please of it.’
‘’Tis well!’ said Condy, with solemnity, folding
his paper and gathering up his drawing instruments:
‘now I must ask the assistance of the
company in this affair. The cat must be black,
a female which has never had kittens, and must
weigh two pounds exactly.’ He also informed
them that the proposed feat could be performed
only when both sun and moon were below the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The company dispersed. John went away
with a feeling of dread for which he could not
account, and which, with his utmost exertions, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>failed to dispel. Could Condy be serious? Could
he really make so diminutive a creature perform
what he had proposed? Yet there was nothing
like jesting in Condy’s manner, and he was not
the man to throw away a joe and at the same time
risk a dozen kicks from John, besides incurring
the ridicule of the whole vicinity. John shook
his wise head again and again, but could not
attain to any satisfactory conclusion. Condy
sought his home in a very different mood. He
laughed heartily as soon as he was in his own
room: for now he had his mighty rival in his
power, and could, without fail, expose him, a
laughing-stock, to the whole county.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As to the rest of the company, they viewed
the matter in various lights. The more superstitious
portion, awed by the solemnity of the pedagogue,
looked upon him with mingled fear and
admiration; while the less credulous part, most
of them young, laughed, chatted, jested, and laid
wagers upon the success of the plot. As more
than a week must pass before the day fixed upon
for the decision of the wager, there was full time
for gossiping; and innumerable were the tales of
witchcraft, ghosts, and horrors which that interval
brought forth. Each veteran talker, male or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>female, had one or more marvellous tales wherewith
to entertain the fireside assembly, and send
the children to bed half terrified out of their reason.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During this time Condy was more busy and
more solemn than he had ever before been known
to be. Every nook and corner was searched for
the mystical cat, and as he paraded the streets
in anxious quest, every one ran to his door to
look at Condy, as if he had been some strange
creature from lands unknown. At length the cat
was found, but where he had procured her he
would not tell. This led people to the very
rational conclusion that she had been lent for the
express purpose by the devil, or that she was one
of the witches who, about that period, greatly infested
the ‘east countrie.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the appointed evening John and Condy,
accompanied by about one hundred persons, repaired
to the spot on which we are now sitting,
where Condy had warned them all to remain:
informing them that if any one crossed the creek
he must do it at the risk of being torn to pieces
by the devil. This tree at that time stood on the
bank with one half of its naked roots projecting
over the water—the earth having been washed
away by the floods. Here John took his seat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his body reclining against the foot of the tree, his
feet firmly planted against a root, and either hand
grasping a root by his side. Condy tied the rope
securely about John’s body, and then crossed the
creek, carrying the other end of the rope to a spot
a few yards from the water. You have planted
a very pretty hedge garden near the water’s edge,
but at the time of which I speak the shore was
bare, and about ten yards from the water was a
fence with a thick growth of alders and rank
weeds. Condy, having fastened his cat to the
rope, proceeded to describe a large circle round
her, muttering incantations and contriving so to
spin out the time as to leave as little light as possible
on the transaction. The crowd upon the
bank stood awestruck in silent expectation. John</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘With half shut eyes, pucker’d cheeks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And teeth presented bare,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>sat grasping the roots on either side, a very picture
of melancholy desperation. Condy, having
prolonged his preparatory measures until it had
become tolerably dark, notified John that he must
look out, for he was now about to give the fatal
pull. At this unwelcome intelligence John’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>breath came thick and hard. Condy whipped
his cat, and cried ‘<i>come!</i>’—the cat squalled, and
John squeezed the roots with the gripe of a giant,
but remained unmoved. Condy now addressed
the stars and planets, calling several by name,
whipped his cat, and again cried ‘<i>come!</i>’ and
again John gave the roots a more than affectionate
squeeze. Condy now talked Irish to his cat,
whipped her, upbraided the stars with their neglect
of him, and cried ‘<i>come!</i>’—still John maintained
his position, while the cat seemed unable
even to stretch the heavy rope to which she and
John were attached. This farce of whipping and
calling having been repeated for nearly a quarter
of an hour, John began to suspect that Condy
had brought him thither for the purpose of making
a fool of him. Irritated by this idea, he incautiously
arose from his recumbent posture, and with
divers oaths and curses, demanded to know what
Condy meant. Condy seeing John thus off his
guard, plied his cat with Irish and hickory most
energetically, and cried ‘<i>now come!</i>’ So said, so
done: down went John into the creek. The
crowd fled from the spot with a universal cry of
horror. John, after having sunk for a moment in
the deep water, reappeared on the surface—cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>his way through the stream with the foaming
rapidity of a steamboat—ploughed through the
mud of the opposite shore, and brought up against
the old worn fence with a shock that tumbled it
in ruins to the earth. Condy hastily cut the rope,
and lifting the heap of rails from his body, begged
him, for God’s sake, to make the best of his way
across the creek, ‘or the devil would tear him to
pieces.’ John needed not much persuasion to induce
him to this course, and he dashed through
the water little less rapidly than when the cat
helped him on. He afterward affirmed, with many
an oath, that, turning his head during this passage,
he saw a fiery-eyed, black monster, of the
size of a bull, and bearing with him a strong odor
of brimstone, leap from the bushes and pursue him
to the middle of the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus ended the business of the night. John
went home as if he had had a thousand devils at
his heels. Condy marched deliberately to his
lodging, exulting in the certainty of having forever
humbled his mighty rival. How did his heart
swell with the idea of having, little as he was,
conquered the mightiest man in Chester County!
‘Now,’ said he to himself, ‘John is down, and so
I will keep him; as often as he attempts to bully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>or look big, I have only to remind him of this
night’s adventure and his crest will fall. Lord!
what a time I shall have of it, and what a nourish
I shall cut among the girls! Not a man of those
boobies will dare to open his mouth where Condy
O’Neal happens to be.’ Thus did Condy exult,
little thinking of the fate which awaited him. He
had no idea that, at this happy moment, his evil
genius was filling the vials of his wrath in order
to pour them on his devoted head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Condy slept soundly, and having risen, proceeded,
at the usual hour, to his school-house,
where he found all silent and lonely. There was
no fire in the stove, nor was there a human being
visible. What could it mean? Condy looked at
his watch and then at the sun, but both affirmed
that the hour was 9, A. M. Was this a holyday?
No! Christmas does not come in November, and
that is the nearest holyday. Condy mused as he
prepared to kindle a fire, endeavoring to discover
the probable reason of the desertion of his flock.
His musings, however, were interrupted by the
arrival of a middle-aged matron, followed by her
children and a dozen scholars besides, who began
to gather up books, slates, etc., and to decamp
without even the ceremony of good-by! Condy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>not a little surprised, demanded the reason of
this extempore proceeding. Madam replied, that
neither she nor her neighbors could think of sending
their children to a teacher who had dealings
with the devil. This was too much for Condy’s
gravity, and loud and long did he laugh as madam
retreated from the room. After his fit of merriment
had subsided, Condy sat down to consider
what was best to be done. ‘To argue with these
people would be useless, and to reveal the secret
of the trick upon John, might be only to hand my
bones over to the surgeon for repairs. Well, I suppose
there are other places, besides this, where
the children lack learning. So there is no use in
grieving about the business; for if I were as sad
as the bottom of a cherry-pie, I could not mend
matters a whit! It is very provoking, though, to
have to run off in the moment of signal victory.
But I suppose I must say farewell to Chester
County.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Condy collected what was due to him by his
patrons, and went off to Bucks County, thence to
Montgomery, and so forth, seeking a situation, but
in vain, for the story of his necromantic exploit
had preceded him with the most awful exaggerations.
Still he kept up a good heart, but soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>began to find that his pocket was growing alarmingly
light, and that, unless something was done
to restore its gravity, he must be famished. Upon
arriving at this very natural conclusion, he faced
about, resolved to go to Virginia, where, under a
feigned name and at a sufficient distance from the
theatre of his unlucky celebrity, he might ‘teach
the young idea how to shoot’ in full security.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His knapsack was already buckled on, his
bill paid, his half gill disposed of, and his staff
grasped in his dexter hand, when he was surprised
by the apparition of one of his comrades
from Chester, who shook him most cordially by
the hand, laughed heartily, slapped his shoulder,
and swore that he was the cleverest fellow in the
world. ‘Come Condy,’ said he, ‘you must come
with me to Chester. It is all out about the cat;
and look here, my old boy!’ Saying this he unfolded
a school-subscription paper, containing a
most imposing array of signatures, the signers
promising ‘severally to pay unto Condy O’Neal
the sums unto their names annexed,’ etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must now inform you how the matter of the
cat had been managed. On the evening preceding
that on which John followed the cat with so
much rapidity and so little good will, Condy took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Adam North and myself, whom he had let into
the secret, to the shore yonder. We had with
us a good rope, which we buried slightly in the
mud; one end touching the spot where Condy was
to make his circle, the other end being drawn
through the fence and concealed amid the weeds
and alders. A stout stick about two feet long,
tied by the middle to this end of the rope, was to
serve us as a handle. On the appointed evening,
some time before sunset, North and I took our
fishing-rods and wandered down the stream, pretending
to be very busy fishing; and when evening
approached, we laid our rods aside and crept
into the midst of the bushes at the place where
our rope lay, which we found as we had left it
on the preceding evening. Our instructions were,
to remain quietly at our post, having our hands
upon the stick, until Condy should cry, ‘now
come!’ when we were to run. We were mightily
tickled, as you may suppose, with the idea of the
ducking and fright we were about to give the big
bully; but our pleasure was not a little damped
by a most unexpected apparition. North had, on
leaving home, tied up his dog, a huge black deerhound,
for fear of his betraying us by his barking;
but shortly after the people had begun to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>assemble on this bank, we saw the black rascal
coming toward us with his nose to the ground.
Our only resource, then, was, in making him lie
down with us and keep quiet; but, to our utter
dismay, when he came up to the place where we
lay, we discovered that he had killed a skunk by
the way. There was, however, no help for us;
and we had to lie close, enduring the horrible
stench for nearly half an hour. When we started
up to run, the hound started with us; but hearing
the mighty splash made by John in his voyage,
and fancying, probably, that a deer had run into
the creek, he wheeled about, gave tongue, and
ran toward the water, where he arrived just in
time to follow John into the stream. This occasioned
John’s mistake about the monster and the
smell of brimstone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The secret had been too good to be kept; and
North, notwithstanding the danger to which he
thereby subjected himself of a hearty thumping
from John, told the whole matter (confidentially of
course) to a few dozens of his intimate friends, and
so the whole matter came to light. I must confess
I was horribly afraid when I found it had got wind;
but John never betrayed any ill feeling toward
us. Upon Condy, however, he vowed vengeance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>most dire. On the matter becoming public, John
was driven almost mad; for he was roasted without
mercy wherever he went. Fancy also came
to the aid of reality; and he imagined that there
was an allusion to his defeat as often as cats, or
ropes, or water, or Irish school-masters were
mentioned. He even ran out of the church when
the parson, one Sunday, read the story of the
Egyptians in the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If poor John was now down, Condy was in
proportion elated. His school nourished to the
utmost extent of his wishes; his finances were,
of course, considerably increased; his popularity,
with both male and female, was unbounded; and
his vanity and good humor were augmented tenfold.
The grin was never absent from his mouth,
and he laughed and chuckled over his cat exploit
as if he had conquered a kingdom. John studiously
avoided him; and whenever accident brought
them into each other’s company, Condy swelled
and looked as big as if he could have eaten him
up at a single sitting.”</p>

      <div class='line'>They wait the spirit’s entrance, as they would</div>

      <div class='line'>The silvery rein obeying, on they flee—</div>

      <div class='line'>It seem’d as though his soul imbibed a ray</div>

      <div class='line'>Or did the aerial spirit by his side,</div>

      <div class='line'>More than the spell unearthly things to view,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>But that alone to guide them o’er the steep</div>

      <div class='line'>Of life; away—the theme we may not tell.</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffice it that the poet’s heart was glad,</div>
      <div class='line'>And could it be, if what he heard were sad?</div>
      <div class='line'>And now they touch’d the land, and reach’d a dell—</div>

      <div class='line'>That mar our earthly revelry. The song</div>
      <div class='line'>From fairy harps floated the air along,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the breezes melting music shed;</div>
      <div class='line'>While odors that no censers seem’d to hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>A stream of luscious fragrance upward roll’d.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And dance went round, a graceful flying maze</div>
      <div class='line'>From tiny feet, that changing glancing rays</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave out around; for o’er their persons shone</div>
      <div class='line'>A light, that from the kindling stars is caught,</div>
      <div class='line'>When with their lustre most the skies is fraught,</div>
      <div class='line'>But all their brightest wassailage—oh, none</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>That ever has beheld it, may reveal;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or gone for ever is his earthly weal,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Waking the fairies’ ire. “Hark! hark, away!</div>
      <div class='line'>Each to his mission—now no longer stay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Go cleave the air, or skim the liquid main,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where its proud billows dash with frantic roar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or break in idle bubbles on the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go do your errands on. Then here again</div>
      <div class='line'>To taste the luscious feast, and sip the bowl,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stay the winged moments ere they roll.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So spake the fairy queen, and stretched her wand</div>
      <div class='line'>The magic sceptre sparkling in her hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>They wait no new command to disappear.</div>
      <div class='line'>And where that elfin band so lately stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Falls but the shadow of the distant wood.</div>
      <div class='line'>No sound but of the river murmurs near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where late ethereal melody was heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>And every leaf unearthly chorus stirred.</div>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE ITALIAN LOVER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Steeped in a mild unclouded moonlight, the
storied domes, arches and pinnacles of Venice,
once mistress of the Adriatic, and still the most
interesting of Italian cities, lay sleeping in surpassing
loveliness. Venice, like Melrose, is best
viewed when lit up by the pale lunar beam which
permits the dark shadows of its palaces to hide
the decay of their crumbling foundations—which
softens its few faults of architecture, and blends
each airy and ethereal turret with the dusk of the
deep sky itself. The soft illumination, mellowing
and mingling their wave-worn halls and arches,
awakes the luxurious inhabitants to life and animation.
Dark gondolas, filled with masks and
music begin to glide along the shadowy canals,
marking the course they take by the undulating
reflection of their lamps in the water. Here and
there, from the windows of some haughty palace,
whence a flood of radiance is poured upon the
night, contrasting with the moonbeams as it falls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>upon the stream without, may be heard the resounding
din of instrumental music, timing the
steps of dancers in the halls within.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where the shadow fell darkest from a mighty
pile, shrouding all below, a noble maiden bent
from a balcony, and listened to a lover’s serenade.
She stood, screened from the light, and motionless,
rapt in mute attention, while the cavalier beneath
her struck his guitar with matchless skill, and
sang a canzonet that breathed the very soul of
passion. At length the music died meltingly
away, and the lady was about to retire from the
balcony.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hist, Contessa!” whispered the singer of the
gondola; “you will not leave me so suddenly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot converse with a stranger, though he
be masked,” answered the lady, “for it is not
carnival time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You jest, beautiful Antonia,” replied the cavalier.
“You would not have listened to my serenade
had you not recognized my voice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right, Count,” said the lady, with a
light laugh. “I know you. But be brief; for
my uncle is within, and I dare not delay. Why
are you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Why</i>, Antonia? Do <i>you</i> ask me? I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>going to quit Venice to-night: it is like quitting
hope, for I know not when I shall see you again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you will not be at Rome at the carnival?
I am going thither with my uncle,” said
the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I dared,” muttered the cavalier with hesitation.
“But it shall be so, Antonia—I will brave
every thing. At Rome, then, we will meet again—at
the carnival.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fail not!” said the Venetian lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will meet you again if I live,” replied the
cavalier passionately. “And if I die, why, my
spirit shall be with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here a slight sound was heard from the apartment
behind the balcony. The lady wished her
lover a hasty good-night, and vanished. The
serenader gave an order to his attendant in a low
voice, and as the light barque shot from the
gloomy shadow of the palace into a bright streak
of moonlight, a voice from the stern commenced
the favorite “buona notte” of the Venetian gondoliers.
The youth and maiden were the Count
Carriale and the beautiful Contessa Antonia Gazella.
We shall rejoin them at the carnival.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c011'>The lady Antonia appeared at Rome before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the commencement of the carnival, and, as she
was rich and a celebrated beauty, her arrival at
the eternal city was soon known and talked about.
Even the English at Rome were infected by the
general enthusiasm, and forgot their national taciturnity
when they saw the Gazella in her open
carriage on the Corso. She was the theme of
general admiration. Artists and officers, counts
and cardinals, Britons and Americans, sounded
the praises of the fair Contessa, and not a few of
the impoverished nobility, fortune-hunters by profession,
ranked themselves in the train of the
lovely Antonia.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But cold was the maid, and though legions advanced,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>All drilled by Ovidean art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though they languished and ogled, protested and danced,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like shadows they came, and like shadows they glanced</div>
      <div class='line in6'>From the cold polished ice of her heart.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In fact the beautiful Contessa turned a deaf ear
to every compliment; and if she listened for a
moment to the Baron Von Konigsmarke, a lieutenant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>colonel of Austrian hussars, it was because
the haughty noble professed to be actuated by a
pure friendship; and, moreover, being a man of
repulsive manners and a dead shot, served to keep
more troublesome admirers at a distance. But
even the Baron Von Konigsmarke, handsome, talented,
mustachioed, and blazing with orders, was
forced to give way, at the opening of the carnival,
to a nameless mask, who attached himself inseparably
to the lovely lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>In no other Italian city does the carnival effect
so great a revolution as it does in Rome. From
whatever causes it arises—whether from the effect
of dissipation, the force of superstition, or the
daily contemplation of vast and venerable ruins—the
dwellers in the Holy City are grave to a proverb,
except during the brief saturnalia licensed
by the Romish Church. Then, indeed, they rush
to the opposite extreme of the wildest gaiety
and the utmost extravagance. The carnival presents
the singular spectacle of a whole city systematically
mad. It is a <i>festa</i> for the noble, a
“beggar’s opera” for the mendicants—and it is
hard to say which of the two classes enjoy it
most. Fiddling, fluting, dancing, drinking, driving,
racing, intrigue, and pelting with comfits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>are a few of the most innocent and intellectual
enjoyments of the reign of misrule.</p>

<p class='c011'>The commencement of the saturnalia brought
an unfeigned pleasure to the gay Antonia, not
only because she entered heartily into the fun of
the practical jests, but because she knew that
there beat beside her in her carriage that to which
no passionate Italian is indifferent—a youthful and
noble heart, warm, happy, and devoted to herself.
It is needless to say that the companion of her
festive hours was the Count Carriale. The gaieties
opened with brighter auspices than ever;
for not one wretched criminal had been led to
the block, to pour out his life for the edification
of the assembled gazers, according to the tender
edict of the sovereign pontiff, who wished, by the
wholesome terror of an execution, to withhold the
multitude from the perpetration of those crimes
to which the license of a carnival might lead
them. His holiness, we are credibly informed,
was much chagrined to think that no felon was
in prison whom, by a little extension of pontifical
justice, he could send in safety to the guillotine.
Unfortunately for his wishes, the pleasures began
without the zest of a single death by the axe;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>they did not close, however, without a serious
accident.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the Count Carriale was whispering some
tender words in the ear of his beautiful mistress,
the horses attached to their carriage took fright,
and they ran at full speed through the crowded
streets, putting to flight the gay masqueraders and
their motley equipages wherever they appeared.
At length, in turning a sharp corner, the vehicle
was overset, and the lady and the Count thrown
with considerable violence to the pavement. The
former, fortunately, was unhurt; but a captain of
the papal horseguards, who had dismounted to
render his assistance, perceived with dismay that
a stream of blood flowed from the head of the
wounded Count. The compassionate old soldier
endeavored to remove the mask of the sufferer;
but the Count seemed singularly unwilling to
expose his face. The mask was at length drawn
off by force; and then it was that the dragoon,
with a cry of surprise and indignation, recognized
in the pretended Count Carriale, the lover of
Antonia at Venice and at Rome, the features of
Maffeo Accaioli, a formidable brigand whom he
had recently encountered on the mountains. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>annunciation was no sooner made than the beautiful
Contessa fainted.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c011'>How pleased were all the Romans when it was
announced that his holiness the Pope had, by a
special exercise of his power, ordained that the
condemned brigand, the formidable Accaioli
should be guillotined during the carnival. How
kind of him! The ladies were in ecstacies.
Even the Countess Gazella was far from lamenting
this ungenerous precipitation, for a woman
once duped never forgives her deceiver; and as
she had already commenced an intimacy with the
Baron Von Konigsmarke, she adopted the opinion
of the old song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis well to be off with the old love</div>
      <div class='line'>Before you are on with the new.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A vast crowd assembled to witness the dying
agonies of the brigand. He was escorted to the
scaffold by the papal dragoons, and a long file of
penitents in their robes of sackcloth, bound at the
waist with cords, their gloomy eyes peering
through holes cut for the purpose in their cowls.
These pious monks begged alms of all good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Catholics to aid their endeavors in getting the
soul of the condemned through purgatory. The
prisoner entered on the scaffold, attended by his
confessor. He kissed the cross, he received the
last consolations of religion, he looked firmly on
the multitude, and lay down to die—the axe descended,
and it was all over.</p>

<hr class='c015'>

<p class='c011'>His eminence, the Cardinal Riario, sat in secret
consultation with the confessor of the dying brigand.
He held a miniature in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he cried, “these are the lovely features
of Rosa Vanelli—Rosa, whom I deceived and
abandoned to despair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Cardinal’s hat and the scarlet robe cover
a multitude of sins,” replied the penitent, sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could laugh at your bitterness,” said the
Cardinal, “did I not hold in my hand this sad
memorial. Tell me, from whom did you receive
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From her son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her son!” cried the Cardinal, starting to his
feet; “mine as well as hers! Would to God I
could see his face! Speak, Gregory, where did
you part with him?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“On the scaffold!” said the penitent, fixing
his savage eyes upon the Cardinal. “Maffeo
Accaioli was your son and the child of her I
loved. What say you? Are not Rosa and myself
avenged?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal heard but the first part of the
sentence, for ere it was concluded, he had fallen
back in his huge chair, helpless and unconscious:
still his fixed and rayless eyes, half starting from
their sockets, glared on the penitent with an expression
that would have appalled a feebler heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The comedy is over,” said the monk. “His
eminence is dead.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>About the middle of the last century, the Moravians, so
much distinguished by their exertions for the welfare of the
most hapless portion of their species, established a missionary
station at the northern base of the Blue Mountains, in
what is now Northampton county, Pennsylvania, a few miles
from the beautiful scenery of Mauch Chunk. This station
they appropriately termed, “Gnadenhutten,” or “The House
of Grace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The savage race which then inhabited those regions were
divided in sentiment with respect to their benevolent visitors.
Some regarded them with veneration; while others, and
they the more numerous portion, looked upon them with a
malignant suspicion, which resulted in a midnight attack,
when the establishment was destroyed by fire and the inhabitants,
male and female, young and old, butchered!</p>

      <div class='line'>And never had his parting ray,</div>
